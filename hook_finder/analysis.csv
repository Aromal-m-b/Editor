51.6,55.44," And now, dear friends, here's Jack Weatherford.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.6632,,
56.44,60.64," Genghis Khan, born in approximately 1162,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.2609,,
60.64,62.24, became the conqueror,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3794,,
62.24,65.44, of the largest contiguous empire in history.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6276,,
65.44,69.6," But before that, he was a boy named Temujin,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3502,,
69.6,71.94, who at nine years old lost everything.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.2956,,
71.94,74.44," His father, his tribe, living in poverty,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.3476,,
74.44,77.56, abandoned to the harshness of the Mongolian steppe.,SPEAKER_01,2,0.4431,,
77.56,80.62, From a boy with nothing to the conqueror of the world.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4668,,
80.62,82.6," So, tell me about this boy.",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3008,,
82.64000000000001,85.68, His childhood and the Mongolian steppe,SPEAKER_01,4,0.4003,,
85.68,87.16000000000001, from which he came from.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3365,,
87.16000000000001,89.22000000000001," The story of Genghis Khan,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3659,,
89.22000000000001,92.08," like the story I think of all of us,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4529,,
92.08,94.64, it doesn't begin at birth.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3817,,
94.64,95.96, That's the beginning of life.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.293,,
95.96,98.64, The story begins long before birth.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3258,,
98.64,101.66," And sometimes it can be many generations before,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3841,,
101.66,103.8, and sometimes only shortly before.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3871,,
103.8,105.32," But I think with Genghis Khan,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3898,,
105.32,109.08," a crucial thing is to understand how his parents met,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4893,,
109.08,112.0, and then how he was conceived.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4703,,
112.0,114.76," And that is that one day,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3402,,
116.04,119.8," a cart was coming across the Mongol territory,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2646,,
119.8,121.96, and only women drove carts.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3825,,
121.96,124.72," Men rode horses, women also rode horses.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2697,,
124.72,126.28," While women owned the houses,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.339,,
126.28,128.4," which were called gears, the tents,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.235,,
128.4,130.84," they owned all the household equipment,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3745,,
130.84,133.32, and so they had to have carts for moving back and forth.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4151,,
133.32,135.42000000000002," And the fact that a cart was moving,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2578,,
135.42000000000002,139.16, meant that some woman was moving from one place to another.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3643,,
139.16,141.34," And in fact, her husband was with her.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3059,,
141.34,142.9," She was a new bride,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4517,,
142.9,147.9, and her husband was on a horse close to her.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3072,,
148.98000000000002,152.78, So what happened was a man named Yasuke.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3311,,
152.78,155.94," Yasuke, the future father of Genghis Khan,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3921,,
155.94,157.74, Yasuke was up on a hill.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2591,,
157.74,159.86, He was hunting with his falcon.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2871,,
159.86,161.78, The words of the secret history of the Mongols,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5019,,
161.78,162.62, were very clear.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.388,,
162.62,164.96," And he looked down and he saw her,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2951,,
164.96,166.26," and he could barely glimpse her,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.405,,
166.26,168.34," but he knew she was young,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4677,,
168.34,169.94, and she was a new bride.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6631,,
169.94,171.5, And he rode back to camp.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3284,,
171.5,175.42," He got his two brothers, and they came racing down.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3579,,
175.42,180.42," And they came, and first the husband of the woman",SPEAKER_00,5,0.396,,
181.3,184.62, looked around and he decided to flee.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5344,,
184.62,186.62," Not because he was a coward,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5005,,
186.62,190.42, but he figured he would probably pull the men after him.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5491,,
190.42,192.56," They would chase him, and they did.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3304,,
192.56,194.74," They chased him, he went far away.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3698,,
194.74,197.3," He circled around, he came back.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5902,,
197.3,200.62, He arrived back at the cart where his wife was.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2554,,
200.62,202.18, Her name was Erlun.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2817,,
202.18,206.1," And Erlun had time to think while he was riding around,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.27,,
206.1,208.66000000000005, being chased by the Mongols.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2567,,
208.66000000000005,212.86, And she decided that it's more important for him to live.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3848,,
213.74,215.82," And she told him when he came back,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2236,,
215.82,216.66000000000005, you must flee.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3483,,
216.66000000000005,220.26," If you stay here, they will kill you and they will take me.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.367,,
220.26,222.22000000000003," But if you flee, they will take me,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3974,,
222.22000000000003,225.02, but you will have the chance to find another wife.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4358,,
225.02,226.86, There are many women in the world.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2996,,
226.86,230.98," You find one and you call her Erlun after my name,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3301,,
230.98,233.66000000000005, and you remember me when you're with her.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6056,,
233.66000000000005,236.22000000000003, It was a very dramatic moment.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.31,,
236.22000000000003,240.26," And he rode away, and he looked back and forth,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2929,,
240.26,242.14," and it said that the pig tails,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.32,,
242.14,244.34, or the braids that were hanging down,SPEAKER_00,2,0.36,,
244.34,247.78000000000003, were whipping back and forth from his chest to his back.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4583,,
247.78000000000003,252.24," He was divided, obviously, in whether he should go or stay.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4023,,
252.24,254.58," But the three men were approaching again,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4327,,
254.58,257.18, and they were headed straight for the cart this time.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4218,,
257.18,261.42, And they came in and they took Erlun.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4101,,
262.46000000000004,267.46000000000004, She didn't say a word until her husband was over the ridge.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3019,,
267.7,269.02000000000004, And when he was over the ridge,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3205,,
269.02000000000004,270.94," and she could no longer see him,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.274,,
270.94,273.7, she began to scream and wail.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4148,,
273.7,275.58000000000004," And one of the brothers said to her,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2779,,
276.54,279.74," doesn't matter if you shake the waters out of the river,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3391,,
279.74,282.54," and if you shake the mountains with your screaming,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3395,,
282.54,285.34000000000003, you will never see this man again.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3317,,
285.34000000000003,287.18, And he was right.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5496,,
287.18,290.62, That was the moment that Genghis Khan's mother,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2324,,
290.62,292.66, and father met.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5175,,
292.66,296.22, That's the beginning of his story in this kidnapping.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3196,,
296.22,298.02000000000004, And it's gonna reverberate.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3595,,
298.02000000000004,302.54," Every detail of it will come back again and again,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6752,,
302.54,305.68," not only throughout the story of the life of Genghis Khan,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.395,,
305.68,308.38, but it's gonna continue on with the feuds,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4822,,
308.38,312.46000000000004, and the issues caused by it all the way into the future.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4612,,
313.29999999999995,314.9," And to some extent in certain parts of the world,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3321,,
314.9,317.14, you could say it still exists.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3543,,
317.14,322.14, So the meeting is fundamentally sort of a mixture,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4633,,
322.78,327.78, of heartbreak and dark criminal type of kidnapping.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.2912,,
328.5,332.04, And from that is conceived this conqueror,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6375,,
332.04,335.5, of the biggest contiguous empire in history.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6559,,
335.5,340.1, What I was really interested in was how did this happen?,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2335,,
340.1,342.14, Who was this person?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5655,,
342.5,345.38," As Wordsworth wrote in his poem,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3976,,
345.38,347.9," the child is father of the man,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2532,,
347.9,350.26, and it's the childhood that created him.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5999,,
350.26,354.08," And it's that episode that was before he was born,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5204,,
354.08,357.62, but all the things that happened throughout his childhood,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4024,,
357.62,360.5, made him into the man that he became.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6412,,
360.5,365.5, And so he was now suddenly this unusual situation,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2733,,
367.46,370.62, was created where a child is going to be born,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3299,,
370.62,373.62, to a kidnapped woman who is being held,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3117,,
373.62,375.82," by strange people, the Mongols.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2318,,
375.82,377.18, They were not her people.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3989,,
378.78,382.62, And he already had another wife or husband.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2508,,
382.62,384.26, He had a wife named Sochigul.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2691,,
384.26,386.28, He had at that time already one son.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.299,,
386.28,388.7, Later he had another son with her.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3591,,
388.7,390.94, It was a very odd situation.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3996,,
390.94,394.48," And in fact, the father, Yasuke wasn't even there",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3273,,
394.48,396.42, when Temujin was born.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2308,,
396.42,398.7, He was off fighting the Tatars,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3435,,
398.7,400.86, and doing this campaign against the Tatars.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6052,,
400.86,403.26, He killed two Tatars.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.435,,
403.26,405.8," One of them was named Temujin Uge,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.273,,
405.8,408.94," which is sort of person of iron,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3223,,
408.94,410.8, is what it means from the Turkic.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4141,,
411.66,414.6," But today, a part of also Mongolian language.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3786,,
415.86,418.5," So he came back, he had a baby,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3219,,
418.5,421.52," and he decided to name him Temujin,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2325,,
421.52,424.46, the person of iron or iron man we might call him.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2453,,
424.46,425.8, After the man he killed.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3829,,
425.8,427.48, After the man he killed.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3829,,
427.48,430.46, So he's a kidnapped mother.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4896,,
430.46,433.4, She's a second wife now.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.295,,
433.4,436.88," Not a legal wife, but just a second kidnapped wife.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3232,,
436.88,441.88, And he's named for someone his father just killed.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3196,,
442.0,444.52, It was not auspicious beginning.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3671,,
444.52,449.34," And in fact, just episode after episode in his childhood",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2547,,
449.34,450.9, was inauspicious.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5907,,
451.84,454.6, The father and mother moved camp one time,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2474,,
454.6,455.6, when he was quite young.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3328,,
455.6,459.42, And somehow they overlooked him and forgot him.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3309,,
459.42,461.48, He was left behind.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2404,,
461.48,462.78, So here's this young child.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3546,,
462.78,463.62," We don't know what age,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3541,,
463.62,466.22," but it could be around four or five, I think.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.633,,
466.22,467.7000000000001, He was left behind.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2404,,
467.7000000000001,470.7600000000001," And as it turned out, some other people,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2671,,
470.7600000000001,474.02, the Taichut found him and then they kept him for a while.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3551,,
474.02,478.14, And eventually he was reunited with his father and mother.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4182,,
478.14,483.14, And it's very odd to me that I never have any inkling,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4295,,
484.04,487.62, of a spark of relationship much between the father,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3882,,
487.62,488.6, and the son.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4628,,
490.1,494.14," Because then when Timuchin is eight years old,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2462,,
494.14,497.7, his father decides to take him off to find a wife.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3753,,
497.7,500.12, Which finding a wife in the Mongolian terms means,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2576,,
500.12,501.74," you give the child to that family,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.422,,
501.74,503.54, or you give the boy to that family,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2284,,
503.54,506.14, and he will live with them and they will raise him up,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6134,,
506.14,508.12, and they will train him the way they want,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5572,,
508.12,510.66, before he could marry their daughter.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3033,,
510.66,514.58," And so he's taking him off at age eight,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3375,,
514.58,516.98," but he didn't take the other son from the other wife,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3905,,
516.98,517.82, Bekhter.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4131,,
518.84,520.5600000000001, He was keeping him.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3607,,
520.5600000000001,523.32, There was something about Timuchin having been lost once,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3147,,
523.32,526.86, and found by the Taichut and reunited with the family.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4315,,
526.86,530.14, And now his father takes him off at age eight,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2425,,
531.0400000000001,534.38," and he was gonna take him to Erlun's family,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2294,,
534.38,535.86, but he never made it.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3865,,
535.86,537.26, He stopped with another family.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3576,,
537.26,539.9200000000001, It's sort of like the first family he came across,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4856,,
539.9599999999999,543.26," and in the words of the secret history,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6054,,
543.26,545.4799999999999, it's sort of like instant love,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4992,,
545.4799999999999,548.8, that there was fire in his eyes and fire in her eyes,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3565,,
548.8,550.88," and he saw this girl, Bekhter,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5714,,
550.88,553.5999999999999," who was about nine years old, a little older,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3494,,
553.5999999999999,556.52, and he wanted to stay there with that family,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2653,,
556.52,558.4799999999999, according to the story.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3748,,
558.4799999999999,561.4799999999999, And so the father left him there with that family.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2539,,
562.52,564.0999999999999," But on the way home,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.391,,
565.36,569.12, the father decided he saw a drinking party,SPEAKER_00,3,0.28,,
569.16,570.82, and he decided to join them.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3079,,
571.88,573.64, They were Tatars.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3823,,
573.64,575.76, He hid his identity.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3627,,
575.76,579.76," On the step, everybody kind of figures out who everybody is",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4129,,
579.76,582.12, and they figured out who he was.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3205,,
582.12,586.32, And supposedly they poisoned him.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.551,,
586.32,589.6," He got on his horse and was able to ride back home,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3901,,
589.6,591.62, but within a few days he died.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3925,,
593.72,598.72, So now Timuchin is off living with another family,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3371,,
600.12,603.04," and somebody comes from his family,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2514,,
603.04,606.52," family, not a relative, but a close person named Mongluk,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4214,,
606.52,608.62," comes to get him, take him back,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2617,,
610.0,612.38, and they make it through the winter.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4433,,
612.38,614.02, They make it through the winter.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4531,,
614.02,618.92," Mother Erlum, by now she has four sons and one daughter.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3117,,
618.92,620.6, I think the daughter had already been born,SPEAKER_00,3,0.365,,
620.6,622.52, or the daughter was going to be born,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3184,,
622.52,624.76, not too long after that.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4732,,
624.76,627.32, But they make it through the winter.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5521,,
627.32,630.48, The spring comes and of course the clan,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3335,,
630.48,632.82, is gonna move to a new camp.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2343,,
632.82,634.98, They go to spring camp from winter camp.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3632,,
634.98,638.48, And they have a ceremony for the ancestors,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4865,,
638.48,640.0400000000001," and they started the ceremony,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5869,,
640.0400000000001,641.84, but they did not tell Erlum.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3887,,
643.24,645.5200000000001, And so she came and she was angry,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3403,,
645.5200000000001,647.72, that she had been left out.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3006,,
647.72,649.2800000000001," The old women said,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.262,,
649.2800000000001,652.48, you're the one for whom we do not have to call.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5105,,
652.48,654.2," We will feed you if you come,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3908,,
654.2,657.0200000000001, we do not have to take care of you.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2663,,
657.02,660.5799999999999," Letting her know that as a captive woman,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4351,,
660.5799999999999,662.8, she was not a real wife in their view.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4442,,
664.02,667.3," And that was really the signal that when they moved camp,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2985,,
667.3,670.18, they were not taking her with them.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4108,,
670.18,673.24, And they packed up and they took her animals.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5694,,
674.74,676.18," They took the animals,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3215,,
676.18,679.6999999999999, but at that moment she still had one horse for a moment.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4589,,
679.6999999999999,681.0799999999999, And she jumped on the horse,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5152,,
681.0799999999999,683.02, and she took the banner of her husband,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3696,,
683.02,685.3, and she raced around the people.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3672,,
685.3000000000001,686.6600000000001, And the banner after death,SPEAKER_00,5,0.358,,
686.6600000000001,689.7400000000001," contains the soul of the person, Sult, it's called.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3992,,
689.7400000000001,691.1600000000001, And so she raced around,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3294,,
691.1600000000001,692.7400000000001, and they were a little bit nervous.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5122,,
692.7400000000001,694.7, And so they camped for one night,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3109,,
694.7,697.4200000000001, and they waited until it was dark.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2648,,
698.46,699.96, Then they took off.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4067,,
699.96,703.0600000000001, And this time one of the friends of the family,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5092,,
703.0600000000001,705.34, came running out to try to stop them,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4511,,
705.34,706.4200000000001, and they killed him.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4109,,
707.7,709.3800000000001, And Temujin cried.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3338,,
709.3800000000001,712.32," He was a little boy, eight years old.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.304,,
712.32,713.46, There was nothing he could do.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3763,,
713.46,714.8000000000001, He's just a little boy.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3232,,
715.5400000000001,719.7800000000001," And now that family is left there on the steppe,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4247,,

729.8800000000001,733.32," When the winter comes, they will surely all die.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3414,,
734.5400000000001,736.7, How do they make it through the winter?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2947,,
736.7,740.4200000000001," Mother Erlun, in the words of the Secret History,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5094,,
740.4200000000001,744.1, she pulled her hat down over her head.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.436,,
744.1,746.0600000000001, She took her black stick,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2437,,
746.0600000000001,749.66," and she ran up and down the banks of the river,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2241,,
749.66,754.2, digging out roots to feed the gullet of her brood.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4181,,
755.26,757.16, She fed them through the winter.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3915,,
757.16,761.58," She found foods, digging up whatever she could,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3276,,
761.58,765.44," finding whatever she could, everything she could.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6681,,
765.44,766.94," And even at this young age,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6993,,
766.94,770.58, Temujin was already beginning to go out to collect things.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3137,,
771.82,772.98, He could get fish.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3482,,
772.98,776.58, He could do a few tasks to help feed the family.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4814,,
776.58,780.5600000000001," It was an extremely awful struggle at this point,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.8384,,
780.5600000000001,783.7, but she saved every one of the children.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2869,,
783.7,788.7," So Temujin's early years were marked by loneliness,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3867,,
788.82,792.46," abandonment, and struggle?",SPEAKER_01,1,0.4397,,
792.46,797.1," Yes, even after this, he was kidnapped",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2842,,
797.1,800.34, at one point by Tai Chiut people.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4593,,
800.34,803.9," He was kidnapped and we would say,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2837,,
803.9,806.2," I think the correct word, re-enslaved.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3453,,
806.2,811.2," They put him into a kank, a yoke, like a ox would wear.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2923,,
812.0,815.86, And so his two arms are in it and his head is in it,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3551,,
815.86,818.02, and he's trapped in this thing.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4457,,
818.02,821.26, And every night he would be taken to a different gear,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3033,,
821.26,823.6600000000001, to be guarded by that family.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4777,,
823.6600000000001,826.58," And one night there was a little celebration,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2793,,
826.58,828.3000000000001," so most of the people are drinking,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4556,,
828.3000000000001,831.5000000000001, and he's left with a boy who's not very smart.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4275,,
832.8000000000001,835.1200000000001," And Temujin managed to take the kank,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2835,,
835.1200000000001,838.1400000000001," the wooden yoke that he's trapped in,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.284,,
838.1400000000001,841.7800000000001, and use it as a weapon by turning it around very quickly,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5258,,
841.7800000000001,844.7600000000001," and hitting the boy in the head, knocking him out.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5428,,
844.7600000000001,846.86, That was one of the first lessons for the Mongols,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2567,,
846.86,850.86, that anything that moves is a weapon.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.28,,
850.86,853.6200000000001," This is gonna go on for generations,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5513,,
853.6200000000001,855.1400000000001, very important for the Mongols.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.667,,
855.1400000000001,856.58," If it moves, it's a weapon.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3693,,
856.6600000000001,860.22," He did that, he raced off in the night,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.375,,
860.22,863.74, and he jumped into the river to hide.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3993,,
863.74,865.7, He's still got a kank on him.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3657,,
865.7,867.72, He's still trapped under there.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.332,,
867.72,869.26, The people are looking for him.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3082,,
869.26,871.6600000000001," They come out and they're up and down the river,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2711,,
871.6600000000001,875.34," and he's hiding underneath the water for the most part,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3687,,
875.34,877.22, trying to breathe as best he can.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5425,,
877.22,880.0200000000001, But it's dark and it protects him a little bit.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5344,,
880.0200000000001,882.0200000000001," They give up and they say, okay, we'll come back tomorrow.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3794,,
882.0200000000001,884.26, He can't possibly escape.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2828,,
884.26,888.3, But the next day he knew one family,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2918,,
888.3,892.4," that he thought he could go to, and he was right.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2738,,
892.4,895.9399999999999, He went to that family and at great risk to themselves.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3249,,
895.9399999999999,899.14," They, in fact, were a captive family of the Tai Chi Yod,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2481,,
899.14,900.94," and at great risk to themselves,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3489,,
900.94,905.02, they managed to saw off the kank,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3031,,
905.02,907.46," and then burn it in their fire,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2819,,
907.46,910.52," and they gave him food to escape,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3763,,
910.52,913.58, and then he had to go find his family again.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3159,,
913.58,918.58," So this is the kind of life that this boy, Temujin, had.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3957,,
918.7,922.26," So he, just to be clear, the neck is trapped",SPEAKER_01,2,0.4157,,
922.26,923.9, and the hands are trapped.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.4726,,
923.9,925.34, We think that's how it is.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3143,,
925.34,926.98, We just have the word.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4589,,
926.98,929.3, They don't say the head and the hands.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.372,,
929.3,931.98," We know that his body is trapped in it,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2788,,
931.98,936.26," but from all evidence we have, it's the hands and the head.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4544,,
936.26,940.54, And he's running around deeply alone with this thing.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6862,,
940.54,942.82," Yes, yes.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.3614,,
942.82,946.22, And then he has to go out and find wherever his family is.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3466,,
946.22,950.44," So this, in part, was the foundation",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3359,,
950.44,952.3," of his breaking with Mongol tradition,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.4048,,
952.3,956.52," that kinship is the most important thing above all else,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.7241,,
956.52,958.34, because here is his life story,SPEAKER_01,5,0.405,,
958.34,960.7, where he's abandoned over and over and over.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.2936,,
960.7,963.06, By his father's own brothers.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3964,,
963.06,965.88," See, the men who kidnapped her,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3144,,
965.88,969.74, they had an obligation under Mongol law and custom,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2646,,
969.74,973.34, to marry her when her husband died.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3273,,
973.34,974.3, They did not.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4928,,
975.54,977.74, They should take care of her and her children,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3275,,
977.74,980.18, because her children are the children of their brother,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3291,,
980.18,983.5," and they count as the sons of the clan, or they should.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.31,,
983.5,985.98," But no, they had all deserted, all betrayed him.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5223,,
985.98,989.84, He learned very early on that you cannot trust family.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2862,,
991.14,995.32," You mentioned that Genghis Khan's childhood,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.264,,
996.24,1000.08," Timujin, was marked by extreme tribal violence.",SPEAKER_01,1,0.413,,
1000.08,1005.0, Can you describe sort of the state of affairs in the steppe?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3657,,
1005.0,1006.44, How much violence is there?,SPEAKER_01,1,0.4075,,
1006.44,1008.76, How much kidnapping is there?,SPEAKER_01,1,0.3388,,
1008.76,1013.76, The story of Timujin is not a unique story for that time.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4704,,
1014.76,1018.48," Now, as an isolated family of outcasts,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.237,,
1018.48,1022.0," of course, he's not participating in the various feuds",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3553,,
1022.0,1024.68, and the raids of the people around him.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3408,,
1024.68,1027.48, But they are constantly raiding in the winter.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5162,,
1027.48,1029.72, And for women and for horses,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3905,,
1029.72,1032.6," and for any kind of valuables that they can find,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6018,,
1032.6,1036.0800000000002, it's almost like their way of getting trade goods from China,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3937,,
1036.0800000000002,1038.98, that one group raids the other in order to find out,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2646,,
1038.98,1043.16, whatever they have for textiles or for metal.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4436,,
1043.16,1044.92, Mongols produced nothing.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6683,,
1044.92,1048.76," They could produce felt to make their tents,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3714,,
1048.76,1050.44, but they were not craftsmen.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3974,,
1050.44,1053.24, And so they had to get these items from somewhere,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3047,,
1053.24,1054.88, and it was through raiding.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2915,,
1054.88,1059.0," And so even in the genealogy of Timujin,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5978,,
1059.0,1062.04, you see going back generation after generation,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3298,,
1062.04,1064.12," of women having been kidnapped,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2562,,
1064.12,1067.2, children born who are not necessarily the father's child,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3079,,
1067.2,1070.02, and it's unclear who the father was.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3343,,
1070.02,1073.06, And all of these issues go back for a long time.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5725,,
1074.3,1076.2," Later, Genghis Khan will realize,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3338,,
1076.2,1077.56," once he becomes Genghis Khan,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2402,,
1077.56,1079.64, he will realize that the true source,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3489,,
1079.64,1083.96, of most of the feuding on the steppe is over women.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4233,,
1083.96,1087.68, And later he will outlaw the kidnapping of women,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3618,,
1087.68,1089.5600000000002, and the sale of women.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4059,,
1089.5600000000002,1091.48," In part, not only because of what had happened",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3373,,
1091.48,1096.36," to his mother, but what happened to him next in his life.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4111,,
1096.36,1100.0400000000002, And this is one of the things you talk about this,SPEAKER_01,5,0.7294,,
1100.0400000000002,1103.96, in some ways the love story with his wife,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4568,,
1103.96,1107.9, was her kidnapping was the defining.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3398,,
1107.9,1111.26," If you could point to one place where Genghis Khan,",SPEAKER_01,1,0.2716,,
1111.26,1113.46," the conqueror was created,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.3379,,
1113.46,1117.02," it's that point, his wife being kidnapped.",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3164,,
1117.02,1120.98," Can you describe, first of all, his love for this woman",SPEAKER_01,5,0.6548,,
1120.98,1125.5800000000002, and what that means and what the kidnapping of her meant?,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2808,,
1125.5800000000002,1130.38," At age 16, Berta, the girl he had met",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3629,,
1130.38,1133.0600000000002," when he was eight years old as she was nine,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2562,,
1133.0600000000002,1136.8000000000002, she's now 17 and she and her mother come.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3677,,
1138.9,1143.9, It's hard to even imagine what it was like,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4082,,
1144.34,1147.42, for this 16 year old boy who has suffered,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3913,,
1147.42,1152.0600000000002, these indignities of life in every way that you can imagine.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.8109,,
1152.0600000000002,1156.0600000000002, And suddenly here is the love of his life,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6624,,
1156.0600000000002,1159.1," who's gonna be living with him, making him happy.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5371,,
1159.1,1161.18, He has somebody who loves him.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.343,,
1161.18,1163.46, It's not just his mother running around getting food,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2905,,
1163.46,1165.02, and trying to feed the five children,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4287,,
1165.14,1168.98, plus the other wife and her two children.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3828,,
1168.98,1172.02," No, he has somebody who loves him.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2921,,
1172.02,1174.88, And it's all the excitement that you can imagine,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6483,,
1174.88,1177.98, with the fire in the eyes and the excitement.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4889,,
1177.98,1181.66, And then it only lasts a few months.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4727,,
1182.94,1184.98, And so there they are.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2952,,
1184.98,1186.46, And there's a lady visiting them.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3071,,
1186.46,1187.78, We don't know exactly who she is,SPEAKER_00,3,0.358,,
1187.78,1190.26, but just they called her grandmother Khoakchin.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3374,,
1190.26,1192.02, Granny Khoakchin is there.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.395,,
1192.06,1194.34, Granny Khoakchin is sleeping of course,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2907,,
1194.34,1197.3," on the floor of the gear, the tent.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2611,,
1197.3,1201.1, And early in the morning she feels the vibrations,SPEAKER_00,4,0.305,,
1201.1,1206.1, in the earth and she knows that horsemen are coming.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4145,,
1206.18,1210.34, She rouses the family and mother Erlun is in charge.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4063,,
1210.34,1212.02, Mother Erlun is still in charge,SPEAKER_00,5,0.432,,
1212.02,1215.02, even though Temujin is now married.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3037,,
1215.02,1217.12, She puts all of her children on a horse.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3509,,
1218.0800000000002,1221.44, She takes the baby girl Temujin in her own lap.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4014,,
1223.48,1228.48, She has one extra horse but she won't take Bersta,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3991,,
1230.44,1232.44," because she knows, she doesn't know who the men are.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3847,,
1232.44,1234.4, She has no idea but they're coming.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3536,,
1234.4,1235.96, They're coming in the dark.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2906,,
1235.96,1237.8200000000002, They're coming for a woman.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.257,,
1237.8200000000002,1239.36, They know there's a girl there.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3175,,
1239.36,1242.12, This family of outcasts has acquired a wife,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2857,,
1242.12,1245.44, and they know that they're coming for that.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2634,,
1245.44,1248.96," And so she leaves Sotchigal, the other wife.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3114,,
1248.96,1251.24," She leaves this old lady, Granny Khoakchin",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3539,,
1251.24,1254.68, who actually has her own cart and she leaves Bersta.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.33,,
1255.68,1260.12, They pile into granny's cart and it's only an ox to pull it,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3429,,
1260.12,1264.48, so they don't get too far before the attackers get there.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5683,,
1264.48,1266.28, But mother Erlun is right.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4299,,
1266.28,1268.8, She's able to get her children off to the mountain,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4767,,
1268.8,1272.52," into Burghat Haldun, to the mountainside away from them",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2198,,
1272.52,1275.0800000000002, because the men are so focused on this cart,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3645,,
1275.08,1277.12, and finding out how many women are in there,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3643,,
1277.12,1279.1999999999998, and who they are and all.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7014,,
1279.1999999999998,1282.9199999999998, So mother Erlun saved her family,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4823,,
1285.08,1290.08, but at a cost suddenly Temüjin realizes,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4614,,
1290.84,1292.88, he has obeyed his mother,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2848,,
1292.88,1296.08, but he's lost the most important thing in his life.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3948,,
1296.08,1299.82, And I do think this is the defining moment of his life.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.589,,
1300.72,1303.58, The story began back when his mother was kidnapped,SPEAKER_00,3,0.336,,
1303.58,1306.1," but now the kidnapping of his wife,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3683,,
1306.1,1308.02, I think it's to define what will he do?,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3706,,
1308.02,1308.9, What should he do?,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2175,,
1308.9,1310.66, What can he do?,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4104,,
1310.66,1314.38, Is he going to just resign himself to it?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4502,,
1316.3,1318.66, Is he going to go out look for another wife?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2857,,
1320.02,1322.78, And he decides that life is not worth living,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4123,,
1322.78,1324.3, without Bersta.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2497,,
1324.3,1327.38, He has found something good in this life,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4695,,
1327.38,1330.78," and if he has to die trying to get her back,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2515,,
1330.78,1333.1799999999998, he will die trying to get her back.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2572,,
1334.06,1339.06, And this is the early steps of the military genius born,SPEAKER_01,5,0.639,,
1339.34,1341.66, because in order to get her back,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2438,,
1341.66,1346.02, requires an actual organization of troops.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.413,,
1346.02,1347.3, He needs allies.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3543,,
1347.3,1348.3, Allies.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3114,,
1348.3,1351.6999999999998, He goes to a man who ruled the Karyat people,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2716,,
1351.6999999999998,1354.54, in central Mongolia on the Tol River,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3206,,
1354.54,1357.66, about where the capital Ulaanbaatar is today.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3111,,
1357.66,1360.9399999999998, He goes there because that Vang Han is his name,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2482,,
1360.9399999999998,1362.14, or Torgul Han.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3369,,
1362.14,1365.34, He goes there because Vang Han had been the lord,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2853,,
1365.34,1367.7, over his father at one point,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2311,,
1367.7,1369.7, and his father had gone on raids for him,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2575,,
1369.7,1371.8200000000002, and so he went there.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2829,,
1371.8200000000002,1373.46, And actually he took a gift.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3781,,
1373.46,1377.9, That's because Bersta's mother had brought a sable coat,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3281,,
1377.9,1382.9, as a gift for mother Erlun at that time of the marriage.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4468,,
1383.5400000000002,1386.38, So he took the coat and he took it,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4278,,
1386.38,1390.74, and he gave it as a gift to Vang Han and asked for his help.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4835,,
1390.78,1392.34," And Vang Han said, yes.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2866,,
1392.34,1395.3," And he said, I will send some troops, but we need more.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3583,,
1395.3,1400.14," And you need to ask Jamukha, Jamukha, Jamukha.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3877,,
1400.14,1403.94, You need to ask him to come also.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2649,,
1403.94,1408.54," He said, I will send a message to him to get troops.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3914,,
1408.54,1410.86, You have to tell the story of Jamukha,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3115,,
1410.86,1414.86, because the story of Genghis Khan,SPEAKER_01,4,0.2905,,
1414.86,1418.5," is one of people abandoning him, being disloyal.",SPEAKER_01,1,0.5943,,
1418.5,1421.98," And here is a person who's not of his kin,",SPEAKER_01,1,0.3977,,
1421.98,1426.98," but becomes his, in a way, brother, in a way loyal.",SPEAKER_01,4,0.4531,,
1427.66,1431.78," And as you've described, he's both the best thing",SPEAKER_01,5,0.8419,,
1431.78,1433.82, to has happened to Genghis Khan,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3508,,
1433.82,1435.98, and one of the biggest challenges,SPEAKER_01,5,0.7847,,
1435.98,1439.02, in the later years to Genghis Khan.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3128,,
1439.02,1441.02, So who was Jamukha?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3498,,
1441.02,1446.02, Jamukha was a boy about the same age as Temujin,SPEAKER_00,3,0.273,,
1446.34,1448.9, and his family had winter camp,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3524,,
1448.9,1452.78, close to where mother Erlun was living with her children.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.462,,
1452.78,1455.62, And so the two boys met during the winter time.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.34,,
1455.62,1458.82," In fact, they both claimed dissent from the same woman",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4448,,
1458.82,1461.46," about four generations earlier or five,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.314,,
1461.46,1462.74, it's a little unclear.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.6132,,
1462.74,1466.46, She was Urihanghai woman who herself was kidnapped.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2474,,
1466.46,1469.74, And actually Jamukha was the descendant of her,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2574,,
1469.74,1471.66, from the fact that she was pregnant,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2855,,
1471.66,1473.34, at the moment of kidnapping.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3803,,
1473.34,1476.4199999999998, And then Temujin is descended from her,SPEAKER_00,5,0.257,,
1476.4199999999998,1479.5," through the new kidnapper Botancar, his ancestor.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4305,,
1479.5,1481.1799999999998," So they're both through the,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4705,,
1481.1799999999998,1483.1," as the Mongols would say, from the same womb.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4187,,
1483.1,1487.14, They come from the same historic origin.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2753,,
1487.14,1489.5," However, their lives were similar",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5318,,
1489.5,1491.98," and they both lost their fathers very early,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2806,,
1491.98,1494.5, but Jamukha also lost a mother.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3935,,
1494.5,1497.5, So he grew up in the household of his grandfather.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5477,,
1497.5,1500.74, He had no siblings unlike Temujin,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2701,,
1500.74,1503.1799999999998, with whole household of siblings.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4841,,
1503.22,1504.46, He grew up with his grandfather,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3635,,
1504.46,1506.3, and his grandfather had several wives.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3103,,
1506.3,1508.42," So he grew up with a bunch of old women,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4881,,
1508.42,1512.94, which later he said he thought was an influence on his life.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3394,,
1512.94,1514.62," But the two boys meet,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4543,,
1514.62,1516.3, so they come from different backgrounds,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5132,,
1516.3,1518.5, and Jamukha is not as deprived by any means,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4046,,
1518.5,1520.1," as the life of Temujin,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.434,,
1520.1,1524.1," but he has a certain emotional deprivation, I think,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5662,,
1524.1,1526.22," having not had mother, father, siblings,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2251,,
1526.22,1528.78," and he lives with these old, old people.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6686,,
1528.78,1529.78," The two boys meet,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3698,,
1529.78,1532.8200000000002, they become good friends playing on the ice.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.5476,,
1532.82,1534.78, And so they're playing on the ice.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3253,,
1534.78,1537.5," And then very early on,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3932,,
1537.5,1540.58," I think when they're about 10 or 11 years old,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4553,,
1540.58,1542.82, they decide to make a pact.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3249,,
1542.82,1545.98, It's called being coming anda.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3013,,
1545.98,1547.54, Anda is more than a friend.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4566,,
1547.54,1550.1, A friend is like nukhr in the language.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3126,,
1550.1,1552.3," And there are several different types of friendship,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3653,,
1552.3,1556.22, but anda is a friendship that's beyond a friendship.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.471,,
1556.22,1558.06, It's something for life.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3892,,
1558.06,1561.86, And they swore that they would be there forever,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3988,,
1561.86,1563.2600000000002," to protect each other,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4955,,
1563.2600000000002,1565.5800000000002, to help each other in every moment.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.595,,
1565.5800000000002,1567.7, And they exchanged knuckle bones.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2577,,
1567.7,1569.46, So each one of them had the knuckle bone,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3957,,
1569.46,1572.42," of a roebuck, a deer.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2879,,
1572.42,1574.9," Knuckle bones are used in these games that they play,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4185,,
1574.9,1577.2600000000002, but it's also used to forecast the future.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5454,,
1577.2600000000002,1579.8200000000002, You can roll them around and all.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4939,,
1579.8200000000002,1582.14," And it's very strange on the ice,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4242,,
1582.14,1585.66," I will say in the winter time in Mongolia,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.382,,
1585.66,1589.38, it can be up to 50 degrees below zero.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3614,,
1589.38,1590.8200000000002, And it doesn't really matter at that point,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4174,,
1590.82,1594.34, whether it's even Celsius or Fahrenheit or what it is.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.336,,
1594.34,1597.5, But you slide something across the ice,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4212,,
1597.5,1600.26, and it's just absolutely smooth like silk.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4214,,
1600.26,1602.46, And it goes on for a long way.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4491,,
1602.46,1605.58," And if you put your ear down to the ice,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2604,,
1605.58,1607.74, you hear this celestial sound,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5277,,
1607.74,1610.46, that is unlike any sound on the earth.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3055,,
1610.46,1613.78, It's just like the angels are singing under the ice.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2992,,
1613.78,1617.06," So once they've sworn this relationship of anda,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2685,,
1617.06,1619.1799999999998," then a couple of years later, they swear it again,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2703,,
1619.18,1621.34, but this time they're slightly older boys,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5426,,
1621.34,1622.74, and they have bows and arrows.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3861,,
1622.74,1625.54, And so they exchange arrows with each other.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2636,,
1625.54,1628.94," In fact, the text is very specific",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3358,,
1628.94,1631.54," that Jamukha took the horn,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3992,,
1631.54,1634.0600000000002, cut it off of a two-year-old calf,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2699,,
1635.02,1637.42, and he whittled it down.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4174,,
1637.42,1639.46, And then he drilled a hole into it,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4977,,
1639.46,1642.02," in order to make a whistling arrow,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.347,,
1642.02,1645.38, which is used for several purposes among the Mongols.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3566,,
1645.38,1648.1," It's used for signals for one thing,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2871,,
1648.1,1649.7800000000002, from one person to another.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5343,,
1649.7800000000002,1651.0200000000002," But also when you're hunting,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4287,,
1651.0200000000002,1654.46," if you want to move the animal in a certain direction,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.472,,
1654.46,1657.9800000000002, you send a whistling arrow in the opposite direction,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4086,,
1657.9800000000002,1659.0200000000002, to make the animal move.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4147,,
1659.0200000000002,1660.22, So it had a lot of uses.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5214,,
1660.22,1662.86, So the boys had exchanged roebuck knuckles.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3621,,
1662.86,1664.3000000000002, This time they exchange.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2938,,
1664.3000000000002,1666.66, And so they had been close friends.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3332,,
1666.66,1667.7400000000002," And Vang Han said,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2603,,
1667.7400000000002,1672.42," okay, Jamukha should raise some troops and go with you.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.8286,,
1672.42,1673.7, And he did.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3319,,
1673.7,1676.0200000000002, So the three set out some troops from Vang Han.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5798,,
1676.02,1678.18," He himself did not go, he was too old,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.6339,,
1678.18,1679.62, but he sent some troops.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5167,,
1679.62,1682.22," And then Jamukha and his troops,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2692,,
1682.22,1684.98, and then basically just Temujin and his family.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2635,,
1684.98,1687.82," He just had his brothers, that's all.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2855,,
1687.82,1692.06," They set off to find the Merkit people up the Seleng River,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.322,,
1692.06,1696.22, which flows into Siberia and on into Lake Baikal.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2576,,
1696.22,1699.58, They had to go through some extremely rough territory.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4446,,
1699.58,1703.14," And you see in this episode though,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3861,,
1703.3000000000002,1708.3000000000002, Jamukha is already a little bit fierce,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4272,,
1708.94,1711.86, without necessarily thinking it through carefully.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.352,,
1713.5400000000002,1715.9, He gives this long speech about all the things,SPEAKER_00,5,0.547,,
1715.9,1717.9, they're gonna do to the Merkit people.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.321,,
1717.9,1721.8200000000002, We're gonna jump through the smoke hole,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4266,,
1721.8200000000002,1723.0600000000002, in the top of the gear.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4283,,
1723.0600000000002,1725.5800000000002, We're gonna jump in there and we're gonna kill them all.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3904,,
1725.5800000000002,1728.34, We're gonna kill the men and the women and the children.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.368,,
1728.34,1730.8200000000002, We will destroy these people forever.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7968,,
1730.82,1735.26, He has an extremely militant rhetoric at least.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4379,,
1735.26,1738.14, And he's also rather critical of the elder people.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4843,,
1738.14,1740.38, Vang Han's people came late,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2791,,
1740.38,1743.7, and he gave them this long lecture about we are Mongols,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6244,,
1743.7,1748.3," and if we give our word, our word is our promise forever.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7141,,
1748.3,1751.74," And rain or sleet or snow, it doesn't matter.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.346,,
1751.74,1753.14, We be there on time.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3651,,
1754.4199999999998,1757.62, So he's dressing down his superiors.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5744,,
1757.62,1761.94," He's very aggressive, but he's very helpful.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.5806,,
1761.94,1765.74," So these troops, they move in on the Merkit camp.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3159,,
1765.74,1768.34, They also come in at night.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4047,,
1768.34,1771.8200000000002, And so there's a small amount of warning,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4608,,
1771.8200000000002,1773.34, because some men are out hunting.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3529,,
1773.34,1777.0200000000002, He sables the Merkit men and they race back to the camp,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2566,,
1777.0200000000002,1779.94, and they tell the people and the people are getting ready,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4959,,
1779.94,1782.5000000000002, to get out as fast as possible.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4646,,
1782.5000000000002,1785.1, So Bershta has no idea who's coming.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3853,,
1785.1,1786.98, She doesn't wanna be kidnapped again.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2834,,
1786.98,1788.74," She says, somebody.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.453,,
1788.74,1793.06, So she and the grandmother go action again.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.513,,
1793.06,1797.14," And so she goes, they're loaded into a cart to go away.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3344,,
1797.14,1801.02, So Temujin comes in and there's a full moon that night,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4385,,
1801.02,1802.82, so they could see what they're doing.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5233,,
1802.82,1805.38, And he's really searching for her.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3785,,
1805.38,1808.1, He's not paying too much attention to the battle.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.481,,
1808.1,1813.02, And he's calling for her and she hears his voice.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4949,,
1813.02,1814.42, She knows who it is.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3234,,
1814.46,1817.74, She jumps off the cart and she runs to him,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3325,,
1817.74,1821.9," and they're reunited and he grabs her, embraces her.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6015,,
1821.9,1824.38," And then he said, this is the goal.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4788,,
1824.38,1825.9, This is why we are here.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7129,,
1825.9,1828.46, We don't need anything else.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2254,,
1828.46,1830.26, He was very clear about that.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.329,,
1831.14,1836.14, And that was his first full-on military engagement.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3661,,
1838.02,1839.38," Yes, aside from the things,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3602,,
1839.38,1842.3," yes, his first full-on military engagement.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4843,,
1842.3,1847.3," Now along the way, in addition to escaping all these horrors,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5802,,
1847.46,1851.74," he had killed his older half-brother, Begter.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.257,,
1851.74,1854.78, And that too was a deeply formative experience.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4661,,
1854.78,1856.02, So what was that about?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3221,,
1856.02,1858.58, Can you explain in Mongol society,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3594,,
1858.58,1862.94, the role of the older brother and the power struggle there,SPEAKER_01,4,0.4617,,
1862.94,1866.22," and not to moralize, but there's also",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3313,,
1866.94,1871.94, the ethical foundation behind the murder?,SPEAKER_01,1,0.4006,,
1872.82,1874.38," The killing of Begter,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2908,,
1874.38,1876.46, that's one of the things that's totally unknown,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4409,,
1876.46,1879.02, outside of the secret history of the Mongols.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2088,,
1879.02,1880.58," None of the Persian chronicles,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3258,,
1880.58,1882.46," none of the Chinese chronicles,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3199,,
1882.46,1883.82, none of them knew about this,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5189,,
1883.82,1888.58, until the secret history was deciphered and translated.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3304,,
1888.58,1892.9, But Begter was the older child of Sotchigul.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.446,,
1893.9,1896.3, The older brother has complete authority,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6354,,
1896.3,1899.78, over the younger siblings in Mongolian society.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3332,,
1899.78,1902.3, They have to refer to him with a special pronoun,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3754,,
1902.3,1905.86," all the time, ta, and he refers to them as chi.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3315,,
1905.86,1908.58, It's like a formality.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3603,,
1908.58,1911.3," And his word goes, he is the father",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5729,,
1911.3,1913.62, in the absence of the father.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3883,,
1913.62,1918.62, But also it's quite common that if a man dies,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5488,,
1918.86,1920.9," and his brothers, he has no brothers",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2464,,
1920.9,1924.26," or his brothers do not marry his widow,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4912,,
1924.26,1927.66," then if he has a son by another wife,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3649,,
1927.66,1930.86, she will become his wife.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3821,,
1930.86,1933.98, So it would have been common that Begter eventually,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4958,,
1933.98,1936.14, when he passed through puberty,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2954,,
1936.14,1939.58, would then perhaps marry Mother Erlun.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3532,,
1941.3,1945.46," Now, I don't know that that happened,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2968,,
1945.46,1947.58, but I think either it did,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4957,,
1947.58,1950.78, or Temujin was trying to prevent it,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3667,,
1950.82,1952.82," because it was bad enough that he was the older brother,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3448,,
1952.82,1955.46, but he becomes the older brother and a stepfather.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4602,,
1955.46,1957.82, I think Temujin just couldn't handle that.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3835,,
1957.82,1961.02," And he was already, Begter was ordering him around,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.213,,
1961.02,1963.46, so he would take things like a fish,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5036,,
1963.46,1966.02, or a bird that Temujin had caught.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2606,,
1966.02,1971.02, And that's perfectly acceptable in the Mongol hierarchy.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7682,,
1971.26,1973.82, So Temujin would catch a fish,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3837,,
1973.82,1976.22, and Begter would take the fish.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2834,,
1976.22,1977.98," Yes, it's only recorded once,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2935,,
1977.98,1979.62, but perhaps it happened several times.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5221,,
1979.62,1983.06," So that's an okay thing to do for an older brother,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.7638,,
1983.06,1984.22, just take stuff.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3324,,
1984.22,1985.98," Yes, he can do anything he wants",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3994,,
1985.98,1988.06, just about with his younger siblings.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3741,,
1991.7,1993.62, But Temujin is not gonna stand for it.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4776,,
1993.62,1995.9," So mostly in the record,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5139,,
1995.9,1999.14," they kind of put the blame on this fish,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4615,,
1999.14,2002.06, which I'm not so sure that's really the blame.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4361,,
2002.06,2004.7, And the boys had actually taken the sewing needles,SPEAKER_00,2,0.296,,
2004.7,2007.54," from their mother, they were using them for fishing.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3725,,
2007.54,2011.26, And I think it's more complicated than that.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5126,,
2011.26,2012.54," But for whatever reason,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4904,,
2012.54,2017.54," he and his next brother, Hasser, decided to kill him.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2821,,
2017.58,2018.66, And they did.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3256,,
2018.66,2020.98, Why to you is it more complicated than that?,SPEAKER_01,2,0.3287,,
2020.98,2023.98, It feels to me like stealing of a fish,SPEAKER_01,2,0.3209,,
2023.98,2025.82, is like the final straw.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3277,,
2025.82,2030.78," Here he's being abused over and over and over,",SPEAKER_01,2,0.2522,,
2030.78,2032.82, and the fish is a symbol of that.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4048,,
2032.82,2036.66, And so here he takes matters into his own hands.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3659,,
2036.66,2038.3," I think it is the symbol of that,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2715,,
2038.3,2041.58, and it can be the thing that pushes him over the edge.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3247,,
2041.58,2043.26, But it's all these other tensions,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3521,,
2043.26,2045.7, of what's going on with the family.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.422,,
2045.7,2049.06," Because they shoot him with arrows, they kill him.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4492,,
2049.06,2052.7000000000003, But what happens afterwards is also interesting,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5127,,
2052.7000000000003,2054.9," for the dynamics of what was going on before,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.5007,,
2054.9,2058.62, because we hear nothing from Sotchigo.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.284,,
2058.62,2061.38," She and her younger son, Belgetai,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3849,,
2061.38,2063.86," they stay with the family, they don't go away.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3481,,
2063.94,2067.86," The one who is outraged is Mother Erlun, his mother.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3138,,
2067.86,2070.02, She screams and hollers at him,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2852,,
2070.02,2073.94, in the longest kind of tirade you can imagine,SPEAKER_00,3,0.226,,
2073.94,2076.6600000000003, about you will never have anybody in your life,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4386,,
2076.6600000000003,2078.38, except your own shadow.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3135,,
2078.38,2082.82, And you are worse than everything that she could name.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5679,,
2082.82,2084.2200000000003, They could be worse than.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4031,,
2084.2200000000003,2087.6200000000003, She was outraged and went on and on and on about it.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3958,,
2087.6200000000003,2092.6200000000003, So she was obviously extremely distressed about it.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.505,,
2092.9,2095.7," Whereas Sotchigo, the mother of the boy,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3605,,
2095.7,2097.26," she may have been distressed, I don't know,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3704,,
2097.26,2100.58, but nothing is shown up in the record.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.416,,
2100.58,2102.06, So he does have this episode,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3976,,
2102.06,2104.34, of having killed off his brother.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2718,,
2104.34,2107.18," But I don't think it was a deeply meaningful,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5286,,
2107.18,2108.58," I think it was important,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4091,,
2108.58,2110.86, but I don't think it was a mostly deeply meaningful,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5868,,
2110.86,2111.98, for Temujin.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3533,,
2113.06,2116.1," The brother was gone, the problem was solved.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3965,,
2116.1,2119.98," Mother is extremely ticked off at him, but.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3648,,
2120.9,2123.86," But it does show, in fact, it's interesting",SPEAKER_01,3,0.5738,,
2123.86,2125.3," if it's not a big deal for him,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.5638,,
2125.3,2130.22, it does show that he's willing to resort to murder,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4636,,
2130.22,2134.38, to take care of a bad situation.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3308,,
2134.38,2135.5, Yes.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2993,,
2135.5,2139.38, He is capable of doing anything that needs to be done,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4885,,
2139.38,2142.18, to resolve what he sees as a problem.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4358,,
2142.18,2143.98, Bechter was a problem.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.375,,
2143.98,2147.58, He resolved it at a very young age.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3776,,
2147.58,2150.14, So he'd had that experience behind him.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5231,,
2150.14,2153.14," But now, Bechter's younger brother, Belgetai,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4062,,
2153.14,2155.22, is on the raid with him and with Tomoko,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3971,,
2155.22,2158.02, when they go to capture Burshta back.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2604,,
2159.06,2163.42," So he has both loyalty,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3248,,
2163.42,2167.14, and Belgetai stays loyal to him his entire life.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7107,,
2167.14,2168.34, His entire life.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6113,,
2169.3,2171.1, It was very interesting.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.48,,
2171.1,2173.18," So actually, if we return to Burshta,",SPEAKER_01,2,0.3381,,
2173.22,2177.78, is it normal to have such a love story across many years,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3059,,
2177.78,2179.26," when you're separated,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.2799,,
2179.26,2181.18, and sort of having that kind of loyalty?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3992,,
2181.18,2186.06," Because it was two-way loyalty from Burshta to Temujin,",SPEAKER_01,2,0.2214,,
2186.06,2188.74," and Temujin to Burshta,",SPEAKER_01,1,0.4085,,
2188.74,2191.9, and this is like before he was Genghis Khan.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6366,,
2191.9,2195.54," I think as children, he was too preoccupied",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4493,,
2195.54,2198.42, with staying alive and trying to find fish,SPEAKER_00,4,0.395,,
2198.42,2200.5, and roots to eat and things like that,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5255,,
2200.5,2203.74, to really be pining for her all the time.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3301,,
2203.74,2206.46," But for whatever reason she came,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4798,,
2206.46,2211.46," and it could be that her family liked him in some way,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4979,,
2211.94,2213.34," or that she remembered him,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3004,,
2213.34,2215.7," or that she had no other suitors,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3327,,
2215.7,2219.14," because at 17, she should have been married, actually.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3207,,
2219.14,2221.62," So I can't explain why,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4939,,
2221.62,2224.62," but it was certainly a strong love story after the fact,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4317,,
2224.62,2226.02, if not before.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4013,,
2226.02,2228.94," I mean, those two were loyal to each other",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2416,,
2228.94,2230.38, throughout their lives.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.472,,
2231.38,2236.38, I would say the most important person to him after that.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2669,,
2236.58,2240.6600000000003, He went to literal war to get her back.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4241,,
2240.6600000000003,2241.5, He risked everything.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6414,,
2241.5,2243.34, He was willing to die.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2304,,
2243.34,2244.42, He was willing to kill.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3106,,
2244.42,2248.1400000000003, He was willing to die in order to get her back.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2632,,
2248.1400000000003,2250.26," And he got her back,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2675,,
2251.2200000000003,2256.2200000000003, and now he's reestablished his relationship with Jamukha.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4543,,
2256.38,2259.42," And so they decide to stay together,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3663,,
2259.42,2262.06," and they all go off to the Khoronok Valley,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.219,,
2263.54,2267.3, and she is pregnant.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3757,,
2269.46,2272.02, This becomes a huge issue forever.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5161,,
2273.98,2276.62," It's one of those things that to this day, almost,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4451,,
2276.62,2281.42, it's an issue in what happens.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4356,,
2281.42,2284.46," But as he says much later in life,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4908,,
2284.46,2286.86," when his own sons rebel against him,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2644,,
2286.86,2289.7000000000003," and they call that first child a mercant bastard,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3506,,
2291.1800000000003,2296.1800000000003, he defends his wife viscerously to his own sons.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4205,,
2296.7000000000003,2298.26," He says, you were not there.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4053,,
2298.26,2300.86, You do not know who loved who and who did not.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.243,,
2300.86,2303.7000000000003, You did not see the sky turning around.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3251,,
2303.7000000000003,2305.26, You did not see the stars falling.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3481,,
2305.26,2307.34, You did not see the earth turn over.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2574,,
2307.34,2308.94, You don't know what was happening.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.258,,
2308.94,2312.2200000000003," And if I say he is my son, he is my son.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.416,,
2312.2200000000003,2314.54, Who are you to say otherwise?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2347,,
2314.54,2315.86, You were not there.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.44,,
2315.86,2317.98, You come from the same warm womb.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3279,,
2317.98,2320.1," And if your mother could hear your words,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2117,,
2320.1,2324.98, her warm womb would turn to cold stone.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3462,,
2324.98,2327.58, So he defended her forever.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4226,,
2327.58,2329.5, But he's off now.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4318,,
2329.5,2330.86, We go back to the beginning.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3622,,
2330.86,2331.9, She's pregnant.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.31,,
2332.86,2335.1, They're in the Khoronok Valley.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2979,,
2335.1,2339.34, And he and Jamukha decide to renew their vows,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2965,,
2339.34,2342.02, of being anda to each other.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.462,,
2343.02,2347.94," So this time, it's more serious and it's a ceremony",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5279,,
2347.94,2352.58," in front of the whole, we can't say tribe.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2349,,
2352.58,2354.58," It's not big enough yet for a tribe,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4999,,
2354.58,2357.38, but the whole clan that's there.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3574,,
2357.38,2361.26," And then Jamukha takes off a gold belt,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.316,,
2361.26,2364.14, which actually he had stolen from the market at some point.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3624,,
2364.14,2366.38," And we're on earth, they had a gold belt.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5349,,
2366.38,2367.22, I don't know why.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3737,,
2367.22,2371.46, He took off a gold belt and he put it on Temujin.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2788,,
2372.02,2375.62, And then Temujin gave him a mayor,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2399,,
2375.62,2379.98," who had never had a fault, had never given birth.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3843,,
2379.98,2382.2200000000003, And it was an unusual mayor who had a little growth,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3887,,
2382.2200000000003,2384.5," on the front of her head, which they called a horn.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3567,,
2384.5,2387.02," So it was an unusual gift and I don't,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3887,,
2387.02,2390.38," it has meaning, but I don't know all the meanings behind it.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5773,,
2390.38,2391.9, It's sort of odd to me.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.7141,,
2391.9,2393.7," But the golden belt,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3295,,
2393.7,2396.3, I can kind of sort of think about it in different ways.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5965,,
2396.3,2399.38," But the gold belt, the belt for the Mongol man",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3346,,
2399.38,2401.3, is really the sign of manhood.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5139,,
2402.1800000000003,2407.1800000000003," And in fact, this belt, a woman was often then",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2541,,
2407.1800000000003,2410.9, and even now called person without a belt,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4082,,
2410.9,2412.3, because that's how they were at that time.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.326,,
2412.3,2414.54," Today, women wear belts, of course,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3249,,
2414.54,2419.06," but they still use the word, buskwi, buskwi, with no belt.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3663,,
2419.06,2421.46, So it's a very important symbol of manhood.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4358,,
2421.46,2425.9, So he gave that to Temujin and they celebrated.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3504,,
2425.9,2428.5," And then the words of the secret history,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4894,,
2428.5,2430.66," they slept apart under the same blanket,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4018,,
2430.66,2435.06," apart from the other group, and they were happy together.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.441,,
2435.06,2437.0," And then when the baby was born,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2381,,
2439.38,2444.38," Temujin named the baby Tz'ch, which means visitor.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2632,,
2446.14,2446.98," Some people say, well,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4023,,
2446.98,2450.3, it's because the child was really the market child.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2871,,
2450.3,2452.42," Other people say, no, it's because he was a visitor",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2993,,
2452.42,2455.38, on the territory of Jamuk at that time.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2769,,
2455.38,2459.1800000000003," And other people can say, well, but Jamukha's ancestor",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3375,,
2459.1800000000003,2462.94," who had been born from the kidnapped woman who was pregnant,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2853,,
2462.94,2467.86," that they had named that Tz'arig'dai, which meant foreigner.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3938,,
2467.86,2470.82," So it's kind of like a parallel, the visitor, the foreigner.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.6357,,
2470.82,2474.1, And so Jamukha's clan took the name from him.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2617,,
2474.1,2476.26, They were called Tz'arig'dai.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2891,,
2476.26,2479.6600000000003, And so there are all these things,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4653,,
2479.6600000000003,2482.6600000000003, that sometimes we can't quite understand,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4965,,
2482.66,2485.66, because we don't have the total mentality of that time,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3118,,
2485.66,2487.54, and we're not there.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4313,,
2487.54,2491.18," But we should say that, I think it's a pretty powerful part",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4263,,
2491.18,2496.18, of this love story is that the child is likely not his,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3598,,
2497.42,2500.34, and he accepted that child as his own,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4952,,
2500.34,2503.96, and defended it as it becomes much more important later,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4134,,
2503.96,2507.24, as his first child.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.4252,,
2507.24,2511.46," Yes, he defends his child through his entire life.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6147,,
2511.46,2515.74," And, but not long after the birth,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.501,,
2517.3,2519.66," he and Jamukha break apart,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3117,,
2519.66,2522.46, or really it's Temujin breaks apart,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5091,,
2522.46,2525.62, at the urging of Ursta.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.316,,
2525.62,2529.56," She said, he lords it over you too much.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4193,,
2529.56,2531.8, He orders you around too much.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3641,,
2531.8,2532.9, You need to be free.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3294,,
2532.9,2534.54, We need to break away.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2497,,
2534.54,2539.1, And she urged him and he loved his wife more than anything.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.8081,,
2539.1,2540.58," I think that in a certain way,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5629,,
2540.58,2543.74," the most important other character in his life,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4723,,
2543.74,2546.94," adult life would be the anda relationship,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3848,,
2546.94,2551.1, which gets up being severely tested in the future years.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3018,,
2551.1,2552.78, But they run away through the night.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4943,,
2552.78,2556.4, They go all night long to escape from him.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3012,,
2556.4,2559.3, But he obviously loved birth the most,SPEAKER_00,3,0.332,,
2559.3,2563.04, and took the baby of course with them as well.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4909,,
2563.04,2566.34, So here's this breaking point of the anda.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3391,,
2566.34,2568.24, How did that relationship evolve?,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2261,,
2568.24,2571.1600000000003, The two of them never claimed to break it.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.3609,,
2572.1600000000003,2573.7000000000003, They had just separated.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3862,,
2574.6000000000004,2579.2000000000003," And now we have the banghan,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4714,,
2579.2000000000003,2581.28, the most powerful ruler on the steppe,SPEAKER_00,5,0.8305,,
2581.28,2585.78, who's ruling out of central Mongolia of the Karyat people.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3209,,
2585.78,2588.76," And so Jamukha remains loyal to him,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4403,,
2588.76,2591.28, but at first so does Temujin.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4087,,
2591.28,2592.34," They're both loyal to him,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5019,,
2592.34,2596.0600000000004, but they're fighting in different kinds of campaigns and all.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4712,,
2596.06,2599.32," So for a while, they're not fighting each other.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5096,,
2600.34,2602.98, But eventually some things happened,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5522,,
2602.98,2605.78, that separate Temujin.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2631,,
2605.78,2610.78, Temujin was making all of these great victories for banghan.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7546,,
2611.06,2613.24," And he was even got the title bang,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3147,,
2613.24,2617.5, which means from Chinese meaning prince or king.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2577,,
2619.14,2621.74, A banghan received that from the Jin dynasty,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2975,,
2621.74,2625.46, because of all of these conquests against the Tatar people.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.457,,
2625.46,2627.9, So Temujin was rising up,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4345,,
2627.9,2632.86, and then he wanted his son to marry the daughter of banghan.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2954,,
2632.86,2634.52, And banghan said no.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6441,,
2635.5,2640.02," His own son told the father, no, no, no, no.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5581,,
2640.02,2641.66, We don't marry those low people.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4649,,
2641.66,2642.62, They're Mongols.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3631,,
2642.62,2644.14, They're not like us.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.5097,,
2644.14,2646.06, We are Karyat people.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.485,,
2646.06,2647.54, We're not gonna marry them.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4512,,
2647.54,2652.54, And so then now war you could say breaks out our feud really.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2314,,
2652.54,2653.94, It's more of a feud.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3415,,
2653.94,2657.5, And Temujin has to flee far away,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2232,,
2657.5,2660.06, into the east to a place called Baljuna.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2279,,
2660.06,2661.14, And he goes to Baljuna.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3139,,
2661.14,2665.42," And at this time, then Jamukha is going to fight",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3106,,
2665.42,2670.06, on behalf of his Lord banghan.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3985,,
2671.2200000000003,2673.54," The two of them do not meet in combat,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.463,,
2674.4,2677.46, but now their forces are fighting each other.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4137,,
2677.46,2678.98, And they didn't see that.,SPEAKER_01,2,0.3872,,
2680.08,2681.82," I mean, there's an obvious tension there.",SPEAKER_01,3,0.4814,,
2681.82,2686.82," There's an obvious if slight breaking of loyalty, right?",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3646,,
2686.86,2687.7000000000003, Yes.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2993,,
2687.7000000000003,2689.46, It's hard to know what's going through their mind,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4914,,
2689.46,2690.3, at that point.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2873,,
2690.3,2691.98, We only have it later on,SPEAKER_00,3,0.383,,
2693.46,2696.98, when the relationship is being resolved,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3299,,
2696.98,2699.9, in unfortunate ways that they claim,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2232,,
2699.9,2702.98, that neither one of them ever truly broke it,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6411,,
2702.98,2705.98, because they never harmed each other directly.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4334,,
2705.98,2710.98," And in fact, then Temujin eventually defeats banghan.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2706,,
2711.18,2713.1, So he takes over central Mongolia.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4493,,
2713.1,2715.22, He's starting to really rise up now.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3397,,
2715.22,2719.4, And he has the title from his own people of Chinggis Khan.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3863,,
2719.4,2724.02, They give him that at Black Heart Mountain by the Blue Lake.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3201,,
2724.02,2726.34," It's a very beautiful, special place,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7301,,
2726.34,2728.58, but he takes that title.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.401,,
2728.58,2731.02, That's not a title that anyone had ever held,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4989,,
2731.02,2731.84, that we know of.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4871,,
2731.84,2736.84," Chinggis Khan, it was a new title that he just thought up",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3388,,
2738.02,2740.46, or somebody thought up or somebody thought it,SPEAKER_00,3,0.284,,
2740.46,2742.82, had auspicious meaning behind it.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3514,,
2742.82,2746.34," It's very close to the word Tinggis, which means the sea.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3388,,
2746.34,2749.26, It could have had something to do with that.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4846,,
2749.26,2752.06," Mongolians really like, we might say puns of,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.364,,
2752.06,2754.82, they like words with multiple meanings.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3417,,
2754.82,2756.1, And that's very important to them.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5681,,
2756.1,2757.98," The more meanings a word has,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2882,,
2757.98,2760.14, the more power that word has.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4715,,
2760.14,2762.66, So if it has different meaning in different languages.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5401,,
2762.66,2767.2200000000003," So in Mongolian, it sounds like strong, chin, Chinggis.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4111,,
2767.2200000000003,2769.74," But in the Turkic, and there are many Turkic people,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3816,,
2769.74,2773.38, including the market themselves are mostly Turkic people.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3058,,
2773.38,2777.3," It sounds like the sea, Tinggis, Tinggis.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2499,,
2777.3,2781.26, So it's exciting to them when there's this double meaning,SPEAKER_01,3,0.5557,,
2781.26,2784.2200000000003, and the double meaning plays with each other,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5398,,
2784.2200000000003,2785.1400000000003, and that excites them.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4382,,
2785.1400000000003,2786.94, Especially with names.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3143,,
2786.94,2790.34," I'm like today in Mongolia, well, I've been there so long.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4748,,
2790.34,2793.1400000000003," I think the fad has passed now, but about 20 years ago,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3675,,
2793.1400000000003,2796.5000000000005, it was popular to name children Michelle girls,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3182,,
2796.5,2799.98," because it's a French name, an American name,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3886,,
2799.98,2802.94, and it means smile in Mongolia.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3757,,
2802.94,2805.58, So it's the power of three great languages,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3339,,
2805.58,2806.9, and three great civilizations.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6419,,
2806.9,2809.3, And so many names are like that.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2913,,
2809.3,2811.46," And so I think Chinggis, it doesn't have one meaning.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4035,,
2811.46,2812.78, I think it means powerful.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3615,,
2812.78,2813.86, It means the sea.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2831,,
2813.86,2815.7, I think it means many different things.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.346,,
2815.7,2819.1, But so he had become a Khan and he was ruling over him.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4211,,
2819.1,2822.3, And so Jamukha now switched loyalties,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2736,,
2822.3,2825.3, to the next kingdom over called the Naiman people,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2365,,
2825.3,2826.9, who are farther west.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2957,,
2826.9,2831.9," And he becomes the protege, I could say,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4303,,
2832.9,2834.94, of the Naiman people.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3145,,
2834.94,2839.94," But when Chinggis Khan attacks the Naiman,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3813,,
2840.7000000000003,2843.02, Jamukha deserts the Naiman.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3977,,
2843.02,2848.02," He tells them, these people have snouts of steel",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2609,,
2848.6200000000003,2850.7000000000003, and they eat humans alive.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5219,,
2850.7000000000003,2853.2200000000003, And he was telling them all these horrible things,SPEAKER_00,1,0.8905,,
2853.2200000000003,2855.1400000000003," about the Mongols, you know.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.284,,
2855.98,2858.98," And Tayang Khan, the leader of the Naimans,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3297,,
2858.98,2861.9, he was rightfully scared about him.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3919,,
2861.9,2863.82, And he was left there.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3538,,
2863.82,2867.82," And he, in fact, was very quickly also defeated.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2449,,
2867.82,2872.38, So Jamukha has not fought against Temujin in this campaign.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3758,,
2874.02,2876.14," And he's off with some of his people,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3273,,
2876.14,2878.74, Jadugan clan people.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2553,,
2878.74,2880.46, He's off with them.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3173,,
2880.46,2885.46," And they see the turning of the tide, you know.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3021,,
2887.74,2891.14, But he now wants to become the great Khan of the steppe.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3841,,
2891.14,2893.9, He has very few followers.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4513,,
2893.9,2896.2200000000003," But he takes the title Gur Khan,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3794,,
2896.2200000000003,2899.54," which is a very old, ancient, important title.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2814,,
2899.54,2904.54," But because Vang Khan is gone, Torgul Khan gone,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3498,,
2905.06,2907.14, that he could take this title,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2608,,
2907.14,2910.42, and pretend to be the great Khan of the steppe.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5921,,
2910.94,2914.66, But his own people turn against him.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3511,,
2914.66,2916.34, And they capture him.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4221,,
2916.34,2919.86, And they think they will take him to Chinggis Khan.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.325,,
2919.86,2921.26, It's not Chinggis Khan.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.313,,
2921.26,2923.7000000000003," They'll take him and they'll be rewarded,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3971,,
2923.7000000000003,2925.38," perhaps, for turning him in.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4448,,
2926.26,2929.14, And Chinggis Khan does reward them immediately.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4407,,
2929.14,2931.06, He kills them all.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4246,,
2931.06,2936.06," Because they have betrayed their leader,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3848,,
2936.5,2938.98, who is his Anda.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3541,,
2939.94,2943.7, It's a very strange encounter.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3779,,
2943.7,2948.38," And so, supposedly, Chinggis Khan says to him,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3002,,
2948.38,2951.94," come back to me, save me, be beside me,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3631,,
2951.94,2956.74," protect me, be my shadow, be my safety guard in life.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.8147,,
2958.7,2961.82," And supposedly, Jamukha says,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3914,,
2963.7,2965.62, but I did betray you.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3084,,
2965.62,2967.66, My people fought against you.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3923,,
2967.82,2969.9, And you will always know that.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6532,,
2969.9,2972.38, And you will never completely trust me.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3767,,
2972.38,2977.38, I will be like a louse underneath the collar of your tunic.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4019,,
2977.94,2982.94, I will be like a thorn in the lapel of your dell.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2801,,
2983.66,2988.3," He said, kill me without shedding my blood.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3669,,
2988.3,2989.98, Let me die.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4582,,
2989.98,2994.98," And if you do, take my remains up to a high place",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4219,,
2995.42,2999.46," and bury me, and I will be the guard.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7062,,
2999.46,3003.18, I will be the protector for you and your people forever.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.8439,,
3004.06,3009.06," So, obviously, Jamukha did not participate in the killing,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4124,,
3010.86,3013.26, but he ordered the killing.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3173,,
3013.26,3018.26, And it's not specified how he was killed,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5265,,
3018.9,3020.38," without shedding the blood,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2509,,
3020.38,3021.9, but the Mongols had several ways.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4313,,
3021.9,3023.62, Because the most honorable way to die,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6482,,
3023.62,3025.3, was without shedding blood.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3697,,
3025.3,3027.06," The blood contains part of the soul,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2406,,
3027.06,3027.9," and if you lose it,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2936,,
3027.9,3029.9, you're losing your soul before you die.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4525,,
3029.9,3033.9," So, they usually wrapped them up in felt carpets",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5794,,
3033.9,3035.18, and then beat them to death,SPEAKER_00,1,0.352,,
3035.18,3038.1," or trampled into death with horses, something like that.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3005,,
3038.1,3039.5," There are a couple other methods,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4641,,
3039.5,3041.3, but I think that's probably the method,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5274,,
3041.3,3043.5, by which Jamukha was killed.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2766,,
3043.5,3046.58," And so, he was killed, and then Tamujin had,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2761,,
3046.58,3049.66, or Chinggis Khan had his remains taken up,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2861,,
3049.66,3051.98, and buried in a high place.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7194,,
3052.02,3056.58," This is over near Tuva, which is today part of Russia.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4167,,
3056.58,3060.54," But until the 20th century, it was a part of Mongolia,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3149,,
3060.54,3064.42," the Tuvan people, very, very close culturally to the Mongols.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3138,,
3064.42,3069.42," It seems that both of them, under the under-relationship,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.4375,,
3070.1,3072.58, had a deep value for loyalty.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5758,,
3072.58,3074.26," And so, the way, you know,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.3913,,
3074.26,3077.42," it's not worth living after you've been disloyal,",SPEAKER_01,1,0.4306,,
3077.42,3081.06," which is the Jamukha perspective, right?",SPEAKER_01,2,0.2796,,
3081.1,3083.78," He had become very practical at this point,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3406,,
3084.78,3089.02, and he understood that you needed complete total loyalty,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6451,,
3089.02,3091.86, and trust with everybody around you.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7149,,
3093.3,3094.78," And I think for this reason,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3471,,
3094.78,3099.78," he was willing either, say, to accept the plea of Jamukha.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3167,,
3100.34,3104.26, And when Chinggis Khan was asking him to come back,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2484,,
3104.26,3109.26," and to be his shadow and to be his safety guard again,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6477,,
3111.38,3113.58, maybe that was just a formality,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3742,,
3113.58,3115.18, that he knew would be rejected.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3667,,
3116.22,3120.14, Or maybe when Jamukha offered to be killed,SPEAKER_00,3,0.293,,
3120.14,3121.34," without shedding the blood,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2509,,
3121.34,3123.94, that was a formality that he thought,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4082,,
3123.94,3125.58, would not be followed through.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.422,,
3125.58,3128.9," Nevertheless, to me, just reading your work",SPEAKER_01,3,0.4069,,
3128.9,3130.54," and understanding this history,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5461,,
3130.54,3132.18," this relationship seems like a really,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5038,,
3132.18,3134.62, really important relationship,SPEAKER_01,5,0.7636,,
3134.62,3139.14, that defines the nature of loyalty for Chinggis.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4322,,
3139.14,3143.38," I would say in both negative and positive ways,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.294,,
3143.38,3145.74, it was the most important relationship,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4592,,
3145.74,3148.46, of his adulthood aside from bursa.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2888,,
3148.46,3150.98, But that relationship really did not seem,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4235,,
3150.98,3153.34, to have many negative aspects.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3752,,
3153.34,3156.3," They sometimes disagreed on things, but small things.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5731,,
3156.3,3160.02, So she was by him and she was positive in every regard,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3514,,
3160.02,3163.7," so far as we know forever, although she was not submissive,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4996,,
3163.7,3166.5, but she was always on his side.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4618,,
3166.5,3171.5," And Jamukha, it was just a little too hotheaded for me,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5472,,
3171.54,3174.34," I mean, in my evaluation of him,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3413,,
3174.34,3177.78," that these things like, oh, we're gonna drop down",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2674,,
3177.78,3180.42," on the market and we're gonna come through the smoke hole,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4213,,
3180.42,3181.94, kill everybody and all.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6123,,
3181.94,3185.34," And he had a flair for the dramatic,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4221,,
3185.34,3188.9, even in a way giving the gold belt to Mujin.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7152,,
3188.9,3193.14," But Jamukha also, he explained himself at the end of life.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3843,,
3193.14,3198.1," And he said, you know, we both lost our father,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2995,,
3198.1,3200.46, but I also lost my mother,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3608,,
3200.46,3203.26, and you had a strong mother to raise you.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5586,,
3203.26,3205.02, I did not.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4436,,
3205.02,3207.06," He said, you had bursa,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3459,,
3207.06,3210.58, you have a very strong wife to help you.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5784,,
3210.58,3214.38," And my wife, he just used a word like prattler,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2335,,
3214.38,3218.02, like she just sort of complains and prattles along,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4516,,
3218.02,3220.78, and we did not have a relationship.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3993,,
3220.78,3225.78," So I think something about that rings true,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4523,,
3225.86,3229.94, that there were some elements of that that were true.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4751,,
3229.94,3233.42, But Jamukha certainly didn't have the intelligence,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4222,,
3233.42,3237.1400000000003," and the real genius for dealing with people,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7933,,
3237.1400000000003,3238.7000000000003," dealing with soldiers especially,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4287,,
3238.7000000000003,3242.6600000000003, and warfare that Mujin had.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4568,,
3242.6600000000003,3245.42," Yeah, in that relationship, there's a contrast",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3847,,
3245.42,3249.78, because Genghis Khan did not accumulate riches,SPEAKER_01,2,0.313,,
3249.78,3253.0600000000004, or accumulate power in a way,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3471,,
3253.0600000000004,3255.02, that was for the sake of the riches,SPEAKER_01,3,0.261,,
3255.02,3256.5800000000004, or for the sake of the power.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2847,,
3256.5800000000004,3260.94, It was always very practical in what is the way,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4269,,
3260.94,3264.7000000000003, to maximize the success of this operation.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5023,,
3264.7000000000003,3267.82," Yes, yes, he, I often wonder,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.2442,,
3267.82,3269.42, what happened to the gold belt?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3952,,
3269.42,3271.98," It disappeared from the story, you know?",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4207,,
3271.98,3274.98," And a gold belt doesn't just disappear, you know?",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3876,,
3274.98,3275.94, What happened to that?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4666,,
3275.94,3277.86, It's so interesting because,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5007,,
3278.74,3281.98, to Mujin was never interested in material goods.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4533,,
3281.98,3284.46," And when as Genghis Khan is the ruler,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2594,,
3284.46,3286.9, he in some ways you could say became the richest man,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5591,,
3286.9,3289.06, in the world because he controlled the most wealth,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6111,,
3289.06,3292.2200000000003," flowing through him, but he always dressed simply.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4317,,
3292.2200000000003,3293.94, He always lived in the tent.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3899,,
3293.94,3297.54," And he said, I eat what my soldiers eat.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4467,,
3297.54,3299.46, I dress the way my soldiers dress.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5542,,
3299.46,3301.38, I live the way my soldiers live.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6723,,
3301.38,3303.1400000000003, We are the same.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2848,,
3303.1400000000003,3305.34, So he had no interest in the wealth.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4397,,
3305.34,3309.82," And Jamalqa, he had sided before with Wang Han,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2514,,
3309.82,3312.2200000000003, which was very advantageous because they had more,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3424,,
3312.2200000000003,3315.06," trade goods and wealthier people and all,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6028,,
3315.06,3319.06," but he just didn't have the temperament, I think,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.468,,
3319.06,3323.1800000000003, that was gonna be helpful for Genghis Khan's continued rise.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3527,,
3323.1800000000003,3324.6200000000003, That is one of the powerful things,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4703,,
3324.6200000000003,3326.6200000000003, about the Genghis Khan stories.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3696,,
3326.6200000000003,3327.94, He came from nothing.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.6563,,
3327.94,3329.7000000000003, From absolute nothing.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.8078,,

3333.2200000000003,3336.42, become sort of corrupted by the riches or change.,SPEAKER_01,2,0.4191,,
3336.42,3339.9800000000005, He fundamentally remained the same person,SPEAKER_01,1,0.3408,,
3339.9800000000005,3342.5000000000005, who does not have value for material things.,SPEAKER_01,2,0.3645,,
3342.5000000000005,3345.1800000000003, He changed and matured in various ways over life,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5417,,
3345.1800000000003,3347.7000000000003," as we all do or we hope we do,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5565,,
3347.7000000000003,3350.9800000000005, but he never became avaricious in any way.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4284,,
3350.9800000000005,3352.3, He was never greedy.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3526,,
3352.3,3353.38, He was never acquisitive.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4431,,
3353.38,3355.2200000000003, He kept the simple life.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.398,,
3355.2200000000003,3357.7000000000003, And part of the simple life for him meant,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4516,,
3357.7000000000003,3360.34, that no one was allowed to write about him.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4511,,
3360.34,3362.6600000000003, No one was allowed to make his likeness.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.458,,
3362.7,3364.54, They couldn't paint a picture of him.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5207,,
3364.54,3367.58, They couldn't make a statue of him.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4861,,
3367.58,3369.86, No building could be built dedicated to him.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.569,,
3369.86,3373.54," No palace, no tomb, no temple of any sort.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5639,,

3379.34,3382.06," It's fascinating that a kid, like a boy,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.4285,,
3382.06,3383.62," that doesn't know the world,",SPEAKER_01,2,0.3413,,
3383.62,3386.34, would have the intelligence to understand,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4108,,
3386.34,3387.58, how corrupting that is.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.4403,,
3387.58,3390.86," Like the moment somebody builds a statue of you,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5529,,
3390.86,3394.3," it's like a slippery slope towards becoming,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.4195,,
3394.3,3395.9," not seeing the world clearly,",SPEAKER_01,2,0.4135,,
3395.9,3400.1," not seeing, surrounding yourself with sick of hands",SPEAKER_01,1,0.5395,,

3409.3,3410.34, that you conquer.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6599,,
3410.34,3413.1400000000003, So it's interesting that he had that foresight,SPEAKER_01,3,0.5002,,
3413.1400000000003,3417.46," of don't record, don't worship.",SPEAKER_01,1,0.8288,,
3417.46,3419.38, That's because that's a dangerous road,SPEAKER_01,1,0.428,,
3419.38,3420.5, to go down for a leader.,SPEAKER_01,2,0.3183,,
3420.5,3424.82," And it's very hard to explain how he stuck to that,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4667,,
3424.82,3426.02, how he got it.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6375,,
3426.02,3428.18, You're so easily corrupted by power.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3014,,
3430.66,3435.66, And yet he maintained this very fierce attitude,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4569,,
3435.94,3439.86," towards his relationship was with the people around him,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4588,,
3439.86,3444.3," his guard mostly, or his private part of the army",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3921,,
3444.3,3446.98," that went with him, the central part of the army.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3016,,
3446.98,3448.86," That was his relationship, his family.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3314,,
3448.86,3450.6200000000003, He had four wives.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2513,,
3450.6200000000003,3452.98, This was what was important to him.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6771,,
3452.98,3456.1," And in fact, no portrait was painted until 1278.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4503,,
3456.1,3458.86," Well, by then he'd already been dead for 51 years.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2977,,
3458.86,3463.86, And then no statue until the 21st century.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4521,,
3466.1400000000003,3466.98, Just incredible.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.8672,,
3466.98,3469.9, But let's go to the document,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3779,,
3469.9,3472.7000000000003," that you referenced several times, the Secret History.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.6457,,
3473.6600000000003,3476.06, The Secret History is a very unusual document,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3698,,
3476.3,3478.86, and I happen to love it very much.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.8106,,
3478.86,3481.22," But I said, Chinggis Khan allowed nothing",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3941,,
3481.22,3484.14, to be written about him in his lifetime.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4176,,
3484.14,3485.82, The people couldn't take notes.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3401,,
3485.82,3489.18," Even the army was, he, Chinggis Khan",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4211,,
3489.18,3491.22, ordered the invention of the alphabet,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4417,,
3491.22,3492.22, for the Mongol people.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3696,,
3492.22,3494.86, And it was adapted from the Uyghur people.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3751,,
3494.86,3498.5," And so to this day, it's often called the Uyghur alphabet,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2869,,
3498.5,3499.9, the Uyghur alphabet.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3251,,
3499.9,3502.14, So he had ordered that and he'd ordered his children,SPEAKER_00,3,0.389,,
3502.14,3503.5, to learn to read and write.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.443,,
3503.5,3507.22," And some did, I think most did not, but some did.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.563,,
3507.22,3510.86," But one of the things he did with every campaign,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4094,,
3510.86,3515.38," even the one at the market when he rescued Bertha,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6073,,
3515.38,3519.74, was he always adopted one orphan.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3237,,
3521.14,3524.7, And that child became a full member,SPEAKER_00,5,0.498,,
3524.7,3527.06, of the Mongol nation in his household.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4073,,
3527.06,3529.7," His mother, Erlun, would raise the child.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4098,,
3529.7000000000003,3533.6600000000003, So she eventually had a whole household full of boys,SPEAKER_00,3,0.435,,
3533.6600000000003,3536.86," of different tribes, but they all became",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3239,,
3536.86,3539.94, very high-ranking members of the government.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6002,,
3539.94,3542.82, And one was the Tatar boy who turned out,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3433,,
3542.82,3545.0200000000004," not to be so great as a soldier,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.417,,
3545.9800000000005,3547.9800000000005, but he could read and write.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.476,,
3547.9800000000005,3548.82, He was the best.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7685,,
3548.82,3551.9," And later eventually he became the Supreme Judge,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.385,,
3551.9,3554.1800000000003," appointed by Chinggis Khan, of course.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3051,,
3554.1800000000003,3556.4600000000005," And so when Chinggis Khan died,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2735,,
3556.4600000000005,3558.38, he recognized it was important,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4198,,
3558.38,3559.86, not just to write down the law.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3467,,
3559.86,3561.94, That's all Chinggis Khan allowed to be written,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4051,,
3561.94,3563.9," in blue books, only the law.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2498,,
3563.9,3567.5," Nothing about him or campaigns or military, anything.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5707,,
3567.5,3569.86, But Shigihutuq was his name.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3722,,
3569.86,3573.38," Shigihutuq realized that this was gonna be lost,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3975,,
3573.38,3576.26, that this is a great historic thing that has happened.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7711,,
3576.26,3577.9, So he compiled the work.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4606,,
3577.9,3580.02," Part of it, I don't know, other people contributed,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3393,,
3580.02,3582.7000000000003," helped him, but it's a little bit unclear.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.5631,,
3582.7000000000003,3584.5," Mongols, they don't specify that.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3112,,
3584.5,3587.1400000000003, They always tell you exactly where something happens.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5501,,
3587.14,3590.5, So we know exactly where it happened in Mongolia.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2998,,
3590.5,3592.7, You can still go to that spot where he wrote it.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2987,,
3592.7,3595.3, That's very important to the Mongols.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.26,,
3595.3,3597.14, And we also know it's the year of the mouse.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5952,,
3597.14,3601.12," So it was 1228, Chinggis Khan had died in 27.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3213,,
3602.02,3604.62," So he wrote down, it begins with what we would say",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3419,,
3604.62,3607.1, are the myths.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4309,,
3607.1,3608.26," Although I'm not sure they're myths,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.487,,
3608.26,3609.46, but the origins of the myths.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3979,,
3609.46,3612.46, It begins with the marriage of a gray-blue wolf,SPEAKER_00,4,0.397,,
3612.46,3614.58, with a tawny deer.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3336,,
3614.58,3616.74," Then some people say, well, that's some kind of myth.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4691,,
3617.14,3619.38," It's totemic, and Mongols mostly,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3181,,
3619.38,3621.54," they look at me, I asked them about this.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2414,,
3621.54,3622.56," They said, what?",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3975,,
3623.7,3628.7," He was named, blue-gray wolf, she was named tawny deer.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2549,,
3628.82,3632.3," They married, you know, very practical about it.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4106,,
3632.3,3633.500000000001, And they think they're real people.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2313,,
3633.500000000001,3635.7," Maybe they were or not, I don't know.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3545,,
3635.7,3638.98, But so this earlier history is just the genealogy,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4301,,
3638.98,3642.22," as it should be, who knows.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4245,,
3642.22,3644.62," But it's also in there because like Bodanchar,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4477,,
3644.62,3646.14, they call it Bodanchar the fool.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3066,,
3646.18,3648.78," The ancestor of Temujin, he's cast out",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3445,,
3648.78,3650.9, because he's just so dumb.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6329,,
3650.9,3652.8, The rest of the family doesn't want him.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4252,,
3652.8,3655.62, And his father is undetermined who he was.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2648,,
3655.62,3657.9, He kidnapped the Urihanghai woman.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3377,,
3657.9,3660.64, She has the child who becomes the ancestor of Temujin.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3464,,
3660.64,3662.58," So it's a confusing mess,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5562,,
3662.58,3665.34, but I tend to think it's probably accurate.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.6605,,
3665.34,3666.7, It has a lot of good information.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.5074,,
3666.7,3669.58," And by the time you get to the life of Temujin,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4649,,
3669.58,3671.58, the reason we know these intimate things,SPEAKER_00,5,0.563,,
3671.58,3675.14," is because that person, Shigihuto, he was there,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.265,,
3675.14,3677.36, sleeping in the same gear with the people.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2933,,
3677.36,3680.5," So we even see in there, he will record instances",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3881,,
3680.5,3684.58," where Berta sits up in bed and tells her husband,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3977,,
3684.58,3686.46," okay, you gotta do this, you gotta do that.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.7417,,
3686.46,3687.66, You can't do this anymore.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.502,,
3687.66,3690.54," We can't think of, you know, it's all recorded, right?",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3949,,
3690.54,3692.62, So it's a very intimate document.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4441,,
3692.62,3694.58, And this is one reason that it was secret.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2471,,
3694.58,3696.94, It was only for the family.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3362,,
3696.94,3699.26, They were trying to uphold Singshan's prohibition,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3025,,
3699.26,3702.7, against putting out information about the family.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3896,,
3702.7,3705.78," So a secret for a very long time,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5675,,
3705.78,3710.26, so much so that scholars began to think it didn't exist.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3584,,
3710.26,3713.54," And then in the 19th century, a Russian academic",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2423,,
3713.54,3718.42," who was working in China at the time in Beijing,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2451,,
3718.42,3722.78," he discovered a manuscript which was very, very odd",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4213,,
3722.78,3724.72, that people didn't think was anything,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3505,,
3724.72,3726.84," because it's all Chinese characters,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2846,,
3728.08,3730.86, but it makes no sense in Chinese.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3824,,
3730.86,3735.34," But he recognized, but if you read it, pronounce it,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3811,,
3735.34,3737.78, it makes sense in Mongolian.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.385,,
3737.78,3741.22, And so it was in this code that had been used,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2928,,
3741.22,3743.88, to record the information in Chinese.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3765,,
3743.88,3746.0, So they're recording the sounds.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.529,,
3746.0,3747.14," The sounds, correct.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4948,,
3747.14,3751.12," They use Chinese characters to record sounds,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3635,,
3751.12,3753.78, which is always problematic in some little areas,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4943,,
3753.78,3756.9, you're not exactly sure what the name is or something like.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4283,,
3756.9,3759.92, But it was a very unusual document.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4703,,
3760.98,3762.3," And then once they found it,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2666,,
3762.3,3765.06, they realized that some of the Persian documents,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3478,,
3765.06,3767.6, had incorporated part of that already.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3054,,
3767.6,3769.22, So that was very helpful to me,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4391,,
3769.22,3771.42, because some of the Persians I trust very much,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5206,,
3771.42,3773.98, and I liked their work very much.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5841,,
3773.98,3776.76, And so it was helpful that it already existed,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3419,,
3776.76,3780.9," and some of it existed in Mongolian,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3388,,
3780.9,3783.74, other Mongolian sources that were written later.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3642,,
3783.74,3786.66, Some of it was just incorporated.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.482,,
3786.66,3789.42," So it seemed to be fairly genuine,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.6064,,
3789.42,3792.1, but it wasn't 100% pure.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.461,,
3792.1,3795.52, It had little things had happened to it along the way.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4731,,
3796.78,3798.66, Some things have been stepped here and there,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5143,,
3798.66,3800.3, and a few words changed.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4312,,
3800.3,3802.62," Like sometimes for Temujin, they call him Chinggis Khan.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3286,,
3802.62,3804.3," Well, he wasn't the Han then.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3928,,
3804.3,3806.74," And sometimes they call him Han, which is like chief.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3187,,
3806.74,3809.3," And other times Han, which is emperor.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2407,,
3809.3,3811.7," Well, in Mongolian it's a big difference.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3972,,
3811.7,3813.18, So there are little things like this,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5268,,
3813.18,3816.02," that move around that you're not sure why,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4173,,
3816.02,3819.3, but it's a document that I have great faith in.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4634,,
3819.3,3822.5," It was not published in English until 1982,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4022,,
3822.5,3825.38, but Francis Woodman Cleves at Harvard University,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3415,,
3825.38,3827.58, translated it in the 50s.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.359,,
3827.58,3829.62, It was ready for publication,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4142,,
3829.62,3832.06, and he was having trouble with the publisher.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4299,,
3832.06,3835.22, And so it didn't appear for nearly 30 years.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4856,,
3835.22,3836.78, It was supposed to be two volumes.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4051,,
3836.78,3838.66, The first volume is the translation.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3017,,
3838.66,3842.5, The second volume was going to be the notes,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3218,,
3842.5,3844.34, and the second volume was lost.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4104,,
3845.34,3849.22," To this day, it hasn't been found.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2752,,
3849.22,3852.22," I would love to see that, but anyway,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4308,,
3852.22,3854.7," now it's in all languages, just about in the world.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4679,,
3854.7,3855.54, Can you clarify?,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2671,,
3855.54,3857.3, So there's two volumes.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.5143,,
3857.3,3861.14, The 19th century Chinese manuscript,SPEAKER_01,4,0.2874,,
3861.14,3863.22, covers the first volume.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.4033,,
3863.22,3864.94," Yes, that was translated",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2739,,
3864.94,3867.22, and then published by Harvard University.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2842,,
3867.22,3870.1," But the notes were just the notes from the scholar,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3606,,
3870.1,3871.74, Francis Woodman Cleves.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2807,,
3871.74,3874.14," Those were his notes, not Mongolian notes.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3052,,
3874.58,3876.86, There are Chinese notes that went with it,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3321,,
3876.86,3879.46, because the Chinese had trouble understanding,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3192,,
3879.46,3881.26, a lot of things in it.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3759,,
3881.26,3883.98," And they also, they disapproved of some things.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3935,,
3883.98,3886.86, So they would try to put their own notes in the margins,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4932,,
3886.86,3890.22, to kind of correct the story and explain a way,SPEAKER_00,3,0.6275,,
3890.22,3895.22, why the Mongols women would be often marrying their stepson.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.226,,
3895.74,3900.34, It just did not match with Confucian ethics.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4321,,
3900.34,3901.66, So there are several things like that,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5674,,
3901.66,3903.34, that they try to skip around.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2897,,
3903.34,3907.66, But so it's interesting just to read the Ming dynasty notes,SPEAKER_00,3,0.6122,,
3907.66,3909.06, that are attached to it.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3399,,
3910.18,3914.06," But the document itself, Mongolian Nutsutopcho,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2922,,
3914.06,3915.66, it's just so important.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6042,,
3915.66,3917.7," And for me, it was the guiding document.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4466,,
3917.7,3921.14, I didn't want to be guided by anything else first.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3864,,
3921.14,3923.1," Everything else I would check, they're correlated",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3054,,
3923.1,3925.54, and fill in blanks and give more information.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5213,,
3925.54,3930.54, But I went to Mongolia to travel around to those places,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3347,,
3930.7,3933.1, because they are so exact in there.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5546,,
3933.18,3934.74, And to feel it.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4961,,
3934.74,3937.46," And it's so important, I think,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6312,,
3937.46,3940.02, because history does not live in books.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2966,,
3940.02,3942.98, History does not live in archives or even libraries,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4832,,
3942.98,3945.9, as much as I need them for my work.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7357,,
3945.9,3948.1, But history lives in the people.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3956,,
3948.1,3951.38, History lives in the memory of the people and the culture.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.472,,
3951.38,3955.42," And for example, the episode with the kidnapping of Berchtek.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3323,,
3955.42,3959.26," So I went to that place and I didn't know when it happened,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4089,,
3959.26,3960.9, what season it happened.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3297,,
3960.9,3963.06, It was very important for figuring out the births,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4833,,
3963.06,3965.42, that came afterwards and other events,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2932,,
3965.42,3966.7, that were being correlated.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4065,,
3966.7,3967.74, Very important to me.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.8158,,
3967.74,3970.46, And so I'm just talking to the people who live,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2966,,
3970.46,3972.62," in that valley, the nomads there.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4194,,
3972.62,3975.26," They said, oh, it's clear.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3602,,
3975.26,3976.62, It was the winter.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3307,,
3976.62,3979.14," I said, oh, where did you read that?",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4118,,
3979.14,3981.62," Said, no, Granny Kwakson was on the ground",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5068,,
3981.62,3983.34, and she could feel the vibrations.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.346,,
3983.34,3986.1," She said, look, this is summertime now.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4204,,
3986.1,3987.46, You're not gonna feel any vibrations.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2452,,
3987.46,3989.06, The ground here is so soft.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4569,,
3990.06,3993.9," Suddenly, a whole important piece that I've been searching",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6444,,
3993.9,3998.9, for just came together from some nomad sitting there,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2945,,
4000.18,4005.18, next to his horse and he was absolutely right.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.8255,,
4005.86,4007.58, It could only happen in the winter.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4075,,
4007.58,4009.74, And that also correlates with the time,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3867,,
4009.74,4010.98, that reading was done.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2959,,
4010.98,4013.06, So it correlates with other historic factors.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5667,,
4013.06,4015.46, But then that gave me the time basis,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4381,,
4015.46,4017.3, for figuring out a lot of other things.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4665,,
4017.98,4019.9, History lives in the people.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4486,,
4019.9,4024.9," Just to link on that point, you visited different places",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3209,,
4025.18,4028.22, that were important to the story of Genghis Khan.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3202,,
4028.22,4030.02, What did it feel like?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2318,,
4030.02,4032.34, What are some memorable things about,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4281,,
4034.06,4036.46, just the experience of standing there?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2643,,
4038.06,4040.18, I really set out mostly to visit the cities,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3287,,
4040.18,4043.46, he had conquered across Central Asia and all.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3894,,
4043.46,4044.86, There was so little to learn.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.405,,
4044.86,4046.46," I mean, everything was kind of known",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4142,,
4046.46,4048.74, of whatever the chroniclers had recorded.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4345,,
4048.74,4051.98, The archeologists had found whatever they had found.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2929,,
4051.98,4054.78, And I get there and he hadn't spent much time there.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3357,,
4054.78,4056.38, He didn't identify with it.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.465,,
4056.38,4057.46, I wasn't feeling anything.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4169,,
4057.46,4061.18," But in Mongolia, I would go to these places",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3875,,
4061.18,4063.78," and I would know if Genghis Khan came back today,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2425,,
4063.78,4065.98, he would know exactly where he is.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3911,,
4065.98,4067.1, There's no road.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4372,,
4067.1,4067.94, There's no sign.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5271,,
4067.94,4069.46, There's no building.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4526,,
4069.46,4072.58, There's no power line going.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.433,,
4072.58,4073.42, Nothing.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6525,,
4073.82,4078.02," Just to smell the air, to feel it, to see the animals",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3178,,
4078.02,4080.18," and to see what kind of animals live here,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4125,,
4080.18,4082.62," what kind of plants are growing here,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2924,,
4082.62,4086.3, you begin to get a feeling for how he was thinking.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.367,,
4086.3,4088.02," And then you begin to see,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3533,,
4088.02,4090.42," ah, I know which direction they came from.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3091,,
4090.42,4092.82, The only direction they could come from was that way.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2829,,
4092.82,4094.26, You begin to see it.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3636,,
4094.26,4099.26, And his life starts to unfold in a very dramatic way,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4423,,
4099.7,4101.06," that I have the text,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2859,,
4101.900000000001,4105.700000000001," but the text is like it has no scenery, no props,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3971,,
4105.700000000001,4106.54, nothing like that.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4283,,
4106.54,4108.42, The Mongols all understand their way of life.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.496,,
4108.42,4110.740000000001, They don't need to explain anything.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2774,,
4110.740000000001,4113.38, They know which way the gear faces with the sun.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3923,,
4113.38,4114.860000000001, They know all these things.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5939,,
4114.860000000001,4116.780000000001," But for me, that's how I learned it.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5235,,
4116.780000000001,4119.02, It was from being with the people.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2538,,
4119.02,4121.54, It was the most important thing.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6982,,
4121.54,4124.900000000001, And this was starting in the 1990s.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3658,,
4124.900000000001,4129.900000000001," And the people, at this time, they were amazed",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4323,,
4129.9,4131.82, that I would come.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2482,,
4131.82,4133.7, The Soviet era had just ended.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3419,,
4133.7,4135.86, Socialism was just ending.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4424,,
4135.86,4137.62, Democracy was starting.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3842,,
4137.62,4140.54, And Chinggis Khan had been forbidden to them,SPEAKER_00,1,0.343,,
4140.54,4142.58, for almost the entire century.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3742,,
4142.58,4145.06, And every known descendant of Chinggis Khan,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6866,,
4145.06,4146.94, was killed in Mongolia.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5873,,
4148.179999999999,4149.78," Following the secret history,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4458,,
4149.78,4153.06, that became the key to writing what I wrote.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4641,,
4153.06,4155.78," Take the history, which is difficult to understand.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3845,,
4155.78,4159.5, You have to go over and I often never understand,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3289,,
4159.5,4162.18, the different parts or I change my mind,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3431,,
4162.18,4163.98," and think it was yes, now it's no.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4457,,
4165.14,4168.26, But the secret history is a valuable document.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4155,,
4168.26,4171.22," And to me, also, it's the opening document",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4666,,
4171.22,4174.26, of Mongolian written language.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2854,,
4174.26,4176.1, And I think it's very important,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6271,,
4176.1,4180.5, how do people begin their written language.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4099,,
4181.58,4184.58," And they begin it with the words deri thinges,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.259,,
4185.42,4189.74," deri thinges, from highest heaven,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4173,,
4189.74,4193.34, came the destiny of the blue wolf,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5382,,
4193.34,4197.34, who was married to the tawny deer and their descendants,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3098,,
4197.34,4199.3, who came from the great sea,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3565,,
4199.3,4201.86, to live at the base of Mount Burhan Haldun.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.495,,

4207.54,4208.94, the mountains and the great sea,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4648,,
4208.94,4213.06," and this kind of, just like a deep connection to nature",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5471,,
4213.06,4213.9, that they have.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4399,,
4214.94,4218.14," Mongolia is a world that, for the most part,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3116,,
4218.14,4220.86, is the same as when Chinggis Khan was there.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3261,,
4220.86,4223.9, We cannot say that far to any other place in the world.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2564,,
4225.3,4227.06," I mean, certainly not for America,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4171,,
4227.06,4228.86," but just a few hundred years ago,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3141,,
4228.86,4231.02, it was entirely different.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4103,,
4231.02,4232.9," People, languages, everything.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5735,,
4232.9,4235.46, But you can't say it for London or Moscow,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3881,,
4235.46,4239.06," or Istanbul, Constantinople,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2691,,
4239.06,4241.14, all of these things have changed so much.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7248,,
4241.14,4243.54, But Mongolia is still Mongolia.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3759,,
4243.54,4247.62, It's one of the largest countries in the world in space,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4091,,
4247.62,4252.1," with the fewest number of people, about today 3.3 million.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3552,,

4265.58,4267.3, You learn that from the people today,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4016,,
4267.3,4270.82," because they are still there, they're still living.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3893,,
4270.82,4274.06, What's the open Mongolian step like?,SPEAKER_01,1,0.2738,,
4274.06,4278.66," As we return to the feeling of Timogen and Chinggis Khan,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.3637,,
4278.66,4280.42, what's it like looking at this place,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4433,,
4280.42,4282.86, that has not changed since his time?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3639,,
4282.86,4284.46, The first thing I think about this step,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5022,,
4284.46,4289.42, is that you can see forever in every direction.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6597,,
4289.42,4293.74," There's no building, nothing to stop your line of view.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5504,,
4293.74,4297.42, And it's like being in the ocean in many ways.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5336,,
4297.42,4299.5, So you have this extremely open space,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2983,,
4299.5,4302.06, and the wind is usually blowing through it.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3808,,
4302.06,4303.78, But it's extremely fresh.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3994,,
4303.78,4306.62," It's coming out of Siberia, it's coming out of the Arctic.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2735,,
4306.62,4309.38, It sweeps down across Mongolia.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.314,,
4309.38,4312.98," Cold is the dick sometimes, but it's always fresh,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4272,,
4312.98,4314.18, always fresh.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7226,,
4314.18,4316.94," So you have the wind coming in,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4738,,
4316.94,4319.26," you have the smell of the wind,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3214,,
4319.26,4322.58, but also then there's grass.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4621,,
4322.58,4325.14, The smell of grass becomes very important.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.435,,
4325.18,4329.54," Now, because of the particular location,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3217,,
4329.54,4330.740000000001," from one year to another,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5289,,
4330.740000000001,4332.34, one area may have grass one year,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4471,,
4332.34,4335.38," and then drought the next year, another area has grass.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4934,,
4335.38,4338.900000000001," So you don't always know, if it's not grass, it's dust.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.407,,
4338.900000000001,4341.740000000001," You have dust flowing in, the dust doesn't smell so good,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.365,,
4341.740000000001,4343.660000000001, it doesn't feel so good.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4764,,
4343.660000000001,4346.9400000000005, But that's just one more part of the country.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4217,,
4348.46,4350.740000000001, The waters are mostly pure.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4982,,
4350.740000000001,4353.5," Now, unfortunately, there has been pollution",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3625,,
4353.78,4358.34, in this century from mining in several areas.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5342,,
4358.34,4361.22," But even when I was there,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3612,,
4361.22,4363.94," even today, when we go to some place like the Selang River,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5393,,
4363.94,4365.98, where we talk about the market lift.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3991,,
4365.98,4369.3, So it's a place of pure waters.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3924,,
4369.3,4372.94," And that's how Mongolians define their world,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4035,,
4372.94,4374.62, is by the water.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3067,,
4374.62,4378.34," They don't, Chinggis Khan does not give lands",SPEAKER_00,1,0.6773,,
4378.34,4380.58, to his sons to rule.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.531,,
4380.62,4384.46, He gives waters and people to rule.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4472,,
4384.46,4386.58," They do not refer to the earth as land,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3625,,
4386.58,4391.58," they refer to the earth as Dalai, ocean, the sea.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2822,,
4391.62,4393.94, And so water is very important.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5686,,
4393.94,4397.78," And to learn the rules about water,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4301,,
4397.78,4399.62, you don't camp by water.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2429,,
4399.62,4401.38," If you camp by water, your animals",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2496,,
4401.38,4403.86," and you are gonna be polluting it, messing it up.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3256,,
4403.86,4406.1," So they're back, maybe in our modern terms,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4757,,
4406.1,4407.66, about a kilometer back.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2846,,
4407.66,4410.82, You take the animals to the river to drink,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3262,,
4410.82,4412.62, and then you take them away.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2695,,
4412.62,4414.86, You do not bathe in that river.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5512,,
4414.86,4417.46, You take the water away from the river,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2319,,
4417.46,4419.22, and you bathe away from the river.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5822,,
4419.22,4421.58, So you do not pollute the river.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.342,,
4421.58,4424.3, The rules are very strict and very clear.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5377,,
4424.3,4426.86, And they're from the time of Chinggis Khan,SPEAKER_00,5,0.503,,
4426.86,4428.3, about how to deal with.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4243,,
4428.3,4430.66," Well, also it's dangerous to live close to the river",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2816,,
4430.66,4432.62, because there are flash floods in the summertime.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3194,,
4432.62,4435.42, You could suddenly have it and it could wipe away,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2929,,
4435.42,4437.78, if your camp is right there by the water.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3259,,
4439.06,4442.62," So the people, they live with nature in a way",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3702,,
4442.62,4444.9800000000005, that I don't see anywhere else in the world.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.264,,
4446.02,4449.54, And even today with the changes with the cell phone,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6516,,
4449.54,4452.5, and with solar panels and they could get TV,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4208,,
4452.5,4454.58," out in the middle of the step,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3305,,
4454.58,4457.1, still they're living a similar life.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4701,,
4457.1,4460.06, The young people of course wanna drive a motorbike,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2548,,
4460.06,4463.22, but they're still herding cows and yaks and camels.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5217,,
4463.22,4465.06," If it's on a motorbike, okay.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.6329,,
4465.06,4467.18, They're still doing it the Mongol way.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.445,,
4468.3,4473.3," But then if we go to the time of Timogen, of Chinggis Khan,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3583,,
4474.42,4477.18, another component is the horses.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3605,,
4477.18,4479.9800000000005, Can we talk about their relationship with the horse?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2963,,
4479.9800000000005,4483.46," Thinking about this open step from a young age,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.477,,
4483.46,4486.46," they've been, all Mongols are trained",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5487,,

4493.66,4497.18, So they learned how to ride while standing on the horse,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4271,,
4497.18,4498.3, from a young age.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4367,,
4498.3,4499.34," While standing on the horse,",SPEAKER_01,2,0.2903,,
4499.34,4501.74, they often jousted with one another,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3542,,
4501.74,4504.26, to see who could knock the other off.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.2977,,
4504.26,4507.42," When their legs grew long enough to reach the stirrups,",SPEAKER_01,2,0.4217,,

4512.46,4514.46, making targets out of leather pouches,SPEAKER_01,4,0.2914,,

4516.94,4518.94, so that they would blow in the wind.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4386,,
4518.94,4521.34, The youngsters practice hitting the targets from horseback,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3847,,
4521.34,4523.22, at varying distances and speeds.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3797,,
4523.26,4526.1, The skills of such play proved invaluable,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4557,,
4526.1,4528.780000000001, to horsemanship later in life.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.405,,
4528.780000000001,4532.820000000001, Can you speak to the relationship of Chinggis Khan,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3464,,

4541.66,4543.22, because that was insulting.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6069,,
4543.22,4545.26," I said, the Mongol and the horse, they live together,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4476,,
4545.26,4547.58, they know each other with every twitch of the muscle,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5266,,
4547.58,4549.5, and they smell the same.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.373,,
4549.5,4553.14," Well, I was saying it just not to be insulting",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2774,,
4553.14,4556.5," about anything, but they have that deep intimacy",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3796,,
4556.5,4559.5, and the horses do know their owner from the smell.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3379,,
4559.5,4560.46, This is very important.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7301,,
4560.46,4562.14, It's also important for Chinggis Khan,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3904,,
4562.14,4565.58," because they made the flags, what they call the sult,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3422,,

4577.9800000000005,4581.06, because they knew the smell of their flag,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2327,,

4593.22,4596.42, I can remember Mongolians being out there,SPEAKER_00,4,0.312,,

4749.42,4751.1, It happened to be on a gelding day,SPEAKER_00,3,0.285,,
4751.1,4755.18, when they were out there gelding the would-be stallions,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2518,,
4755.18,4756.42, who don't get to be stallions.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3152,,
4756.42,4760.780000000001," But this family, they had a bunch of boys",SPEAKER_00,3,0.334,,
4760.780000000001,4762.900000000001, and only together about one or two girls,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3518,,
4762.900000000001,4764.34, were like four or five boys.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3515,,
4764.34,4766.9400000000005, And one boy was maybe 11 years old.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5331,,
4766.9400000000005,4768.3, He fell from the horse.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5454,,
4768.3,4769.860000000001," You could see it, not so far away.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5385,,
4769.860000000001,4771.3, He fell from the horse.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5454,,
4771.3,4772.9400000000005, He didn't get up.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3701,,
4772.9400000000005,4773.860000000001, No one moved.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6867,,
4774.700000000001,4777.46," In fact, they all kind of turned attention away.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4514,,
4777.46,4780.18," And I thought, what am I supposed to say?",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2589,,
4780.18,4781.06, This boy fell down.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.7391,,
4781.06,4782.9400000000005, Somebody go get him.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.517,,
4782.9400000000005,4783.780000000001, No.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5825,,
4784.62,4787.42, And then the boy was trying to hobble back.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3681,,
4787.42,4789.5," He still had the reins to his horse,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3172,,
4789.5,4790.860000000001, but he couldn't remount.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4371,,
4790.860000000001,4792.22, And he was trying to hobble back.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.437,,
4792.22,4795.26, So his little brother went out to help him come in,SPEAKER_00,3,0.455,,
4795.26,4798.1, and they came into the gear and they sat down.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5517,,
4798.1,4799.9800000000005, The mother just turned her back.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4513,,
4799.9800000000005,4802.58," And I'm thinking, how on earth can you do this?",SPEAKER_00,5,0.399,,
4802.58,4803.42, This is a child.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4973,,
4803.42,4804.34, This is your child.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7117,,
4806.02,4808.42," But two weeks later, by chance,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3607,,
4809.26,4811.82," another boy who is practicing for Nadam,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2933,,
4811.82,4815.5," the annual races like this boy had been doing,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5703,,
4815.5,4817.34, he was off in an area right close,SPEAKER_00,1,0.364,,
4817.34,4819.14, to the forested mountain area.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3348,,
4819.14,4822.42," And the horse bolted, took off through the woods.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.6481,,
4822.42,4824.18, He was knocked off by a tree.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4632,,
4824.18,4825.9800000000005, And then the horse went deeper into the woods.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3512,,
4825.9800000000005,4826.9, The boy followed him.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.248,,
4826.9,4828.9400000000005, The boy became lost.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3048,,
4828.9400000000005,4830.9, The boy was 12 years old.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2729,,
4830.9,4835.06, He was lost for two weeks and he lived.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4517,,
4835.06,4837.18, I would have died in 48 hours.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3978,,
4837.18,4838.02, He lived.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.325,,
4838.02,4839.9400000000005," Well, he slept in the daytime when it was warm.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.376,,
4839.9400000000005,4841.860000000001," He walked at night when it was cold,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2906,,
4841.860000000001,4843.3," even though this was the summertime,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3673,,
4843.3,4846.1," the nights can be quite cold, especially on a mountain.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5149,,
4846.1,4850.34, And he sang loudly all night long to keep the wolves away.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6376,,
4850.34,4851.9800000000005, And he knew what to eat.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3538,,
4851.9800000000005,4854.18, And then he walked until he found water moving,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3594,,
4854.18,4857.26, and then he would follow that water down to the neck.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.374,,
4857.26,4858.700000000001, He lived.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.325,,
4858.700000000001,4861.740000000001," And I realized the boy falls from the horse,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3964,,
4861.740000000001,4863.42, his mother's not gonna be there.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3498,,
4864.540000000001,4865.820000000001, She knows that.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3088,,
4865.86,4868.139999999999," And it's probably hard for her too,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.559,,
4868.139999999999,4871.38," to see her boy suffer, but she knows.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3794,,
4873.02,4875.62, Just a small tangent.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3764,,
4875.62,4878.02, There's a wrestler named Kerry Kolat.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3003,,
4878.02,4882.38," And he tells the story about mental toughness,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.4376,,
4882.38,4887.38, that the first time he saw truly mentally tough people,SPEAKER_01,1,0.2188,,
4888.02,4891.82, was when he visited Mongolia for a wrestling tournament.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2537,,
4891.82,4894.34, And he remembered that they were taking showers,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2267,,
4894.34,4896.3, in ice cold water.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.2506,,
4896.3,4899.62," And all the other wrestlers, they would take the shower",SPEAKER_01,5,0.28,,
4899.62,4900.900000000001," and when the water hits them,",SPEAKER_01,2,0.3656,,
4900.900000000001,4902.9800000000005, you could see a little grimace.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4098,,
4902.9800000000005,4907.5," With the Mongols, it was emotionless.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.2892,,
4907.5,4912.5, Sort of like ice cold water or any other kind of hardship.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.495,,
4913.9800000000005,4916.9400000000005, You build a hardness to that.,SPEAKER_01,2,0.2889,,
4916.9400000000005,4919.38, And I suppose that falling from the horse,SPEAKER_01,2,0.3454,,
4919.38,4920.62, is just an example of that.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2625,,
4920.62,4923.34, There's a mental hardness and a mental toughness.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3766,,
4923.34,4926.5, You have to be able to take care of yourself.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3697,,
4926.5,4928.46," And with the weather, for example,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4178,,
4928.46,4930.62," often in that time is still today,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3456,,
4930.62,4933.38," some people, if they can have the privacy to do it,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4834,,
4934.58,4936.82, the men will strip naked in the first heavy snow,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2751,,
4936.82,4938.78, and roll around in the snow,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3401,,
4938.78,4941.74, in order to prepare for the coming winter.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4992,,
4943.06,4945.34," And the valley where I live,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.668,,
4945.34,4947.58, the rest of the wrestlers come there to train,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3715,,
4947.58,4949.66, in the summertime for the competition.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4753,,
4950.42,4953.9, And the water is very cold coming down from the mountain.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4617,,
4953.9,4957.3," And every day when there's a break, they go down,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3463,,
4957.3,4960.02," they take, again, they do not get in the water, never,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5008,,
4960.02,4961.3, but they take the water,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4158,,
4961.3,4964.3, and they pour the cold water over themselves.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4369,,
4964.3,4968.98," And yes, that's refreshing to them, refreshing.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4446,,
4968.98,4971.38," Well, then getting back to the horses,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.3009,,
4971.38,4973.66, the value they had for the horses,SPEAKER_01,4,0.4201,,
4973.66,4975.139999999999, and the horse riding skill,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4805,,
4975.139999999999,4977.22, they developed throughout their life,SPEAKER_01,4,0.423,,
4977.22,4979.54, created one of the most unstoppable,SPEAKER_01,1,0.6748,,
4979.54,4981.5, military forces in history.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4754,,
4981.5,4984.5, So if we just talk about the mounted archery,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4639,,
4984.5,4986.46," that they've employed in war,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.357,,
4987.7,4992.7, the Mongols were able to do targeted shooting accurately,SPEAKER_01,4,0.4335,,
4993.3,4997.1," at 200 meters or more while riding fast,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.279,,
4998.34,5002.02," up to speeds of 60 kilometers an hour, I read.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.3468,,
5002.02,5005.34," So there's a lot to say,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.5777,,
5005.34,5008.860000000001," you have to time and just watching some of the videos,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.2816,,
5008.860000000001,5011.860000000001, just incredible how stable you can be on top of a horse.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.8908,,
5011.860000000001,5014.18, And I guess you're supposed to be shooting,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3149,,
5014.18,5015.42, at a moment of the gallop,SPEAKER_01,3,0.231,,
5015.42,5019.3, when all four of the feet of the horse are off the ground.,SPEAKER_01,2,0.4133,,
5019.3,5021.3, And so you have to time all of that.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2751,,
5021.3,5023.78, You have to position your body to maintain balance.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.4225,,
5023.78,5026.14, And then there's the skill of the actual holding,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3229,,
5026.14,5027.9800000000005, and shooting the bow accurately.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6543,,
5027.9800000000005,5030.18," And there's obviously the technology of the bow,",SPEAKER_01,2,0.3377,,
5030.18,5032.5," the composite bow, the recurve bow.",SPEAKER_01,4,0.3388,,
5032.5,5035.3," They've also, I read, used crossbows later.",SPEAKER_01,3,0.302,,
5036.26,5037.26, They've adapted the technology.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.41,,
5037.26,5039.66, And there's a particular kind of thumb draw,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3988,,
5039.66,5043.22, that you use for shooting with the composite bow,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4493,,
5043.22,5044.9400000000005," that works for a horse,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.3853,,
5044.9400000000005,5047.860000000001," because the thing is bouncing up and down, right?",SPEAKER_01,2,0.3539,,
5047.860000000001,5050.42, So you have to not drop the arrow.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4055,,
5050.42,5052.46, It's just incredible to be able to shoot,SPEAKER_01,5,0.827,,
5052.46,5054.9800000000005, while the horse is going 60 kilometers an hour.,SPEAKER_01,2,0.3967,,
5054.9800000000005,5059.18," Anyway, can you speak to this kind of exceptional excellence",SPEAKER_01,5,0.767,,
5059.18,5062.18, that the Genghis Khan and the Mongols had,SPEAKER_01,4,0.2118,,
5062.18,5067.18, for riding horses and engaging in war off of the horse?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.316,,
5071.26,5075.740000000001," The Mongol, the horse and the bow were a perfect combination.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6659,,
5075.740000000001,5079.700000000001, And it was the most lethal weapon known to the world,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7359,,
5079.700000000001,5081.5, before the modern era.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3522,,
5081.5,5084.02," It was incredible, the synchronization",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6876,,
5084.02,5086.3, and the timing of the movements.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4105,,
5086.3,5088.54," And also the years of skill,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5515,,
5088.54,5091.900000000001," the fact that from absolute birth,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.296,,
5091.900000000001,5093.9800000000005, the Mongols would be on a horse.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3033,,
5093.9800000000005,5095.500000000001," And by three years old,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2944,,
5095.500000000001,5098.700000000001, they would probably be riding alone on the horse.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4345,,
5098.700000000001,5101.9400000000005," Now, when I first went to Mongolia in the 1990s,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2468,,
5101.9400000000005,5106.660000000001," at that time, all jockeys on horses for races",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2349,,
5106.660000000001,5108.500000000001, had to be under six years old.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3343,,
5110.02,5111.1, That was the age limit.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3221,,
5111.1,5114.22, The cutoff was six years old at that time.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3139,,
5114.22,5117.780000000001, And so you had some as three years old racing out there.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3231,,
5117.780000000001,5118.900000000001, It's absolutely incredible.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.8853,,
5118.900000000001,5121.780000000001," Of course, at that age, they can't even have a saddle,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3743,,
5122.62,5123.66, because they can't even be used.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5257,,
5123.66,5125.86, So all they're doing is staying on the horse.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3414,,
5125.86,5128.06, The horse has been trained to do what it has to do,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4901,,
5128.06,5129.179999999999, and they just stay on it.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3825,,
5129.179999999999,5131.58," But by staying on it, they learn the horse,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4237,,
5131.58,5133.179999999999, they become one.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4725,,
5133.179999999999,5135.54," And not just one horse with one rider,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.6642,,
5135.54,5137.82, but one rider with several horses.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.315,,
5137.82,5140.98," They usually, five is the number that you should have",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3408,,
5140.98,5142.74, for you when you go off to battle.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.457,,
5142.74,5145.02," And this ability, they didn't shoot.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.528,,
5145.02,5146.54, You have to defend your animals.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3392,,
5146.54,5148.06," There are wolves around,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3275,,
5148.06,5149.06, there are foxes and other things.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2727,,
5149.06,5150.86," And in some areas, there were even tigers.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3593,,
5150.86,5154.86, And other animals that would come in.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3197,,
5154.86,5156.58, And you had to be able to shoot to defend it,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3743,,
5156.58,5158.94, against other people who might be raiding you.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2232,,
5159.86,5163.179999999999, So they became excellent archers.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4449,,
5163.179999999999,5166.82," They had composite bows that were very powerful,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3396,,
5166.82,5171.06, much more powerful than those of most sedentary people.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6717,,
5171.06,5174.02," Now I say all that because it's very important,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4906,,
5174.02,5178.62, but those are all sort of nomadic traits,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4367,,
5178.7,5181.18, of the great steppe anyway.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.573,,
5181.18,5182.66," I mean, in an earlier version,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3229,,
5182.66,5185.14, you had the Huns who came out of Mongolia.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3164,,
5185.14,5188.14, And Hun is just the Mongolian word for human.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2307,,
5188.14,5189.82," Hun, that's to this day,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3194,,
5189.82,5191.9, that's what they say for a human being.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3302,,
5191.9,5193.66, So they came out of Mongolia.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3493,,
5193.66,5197.62, And all the early Turkic groups came out of Mongolia.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3003,,
5197.62,5200.099999999999, And they had the similar skills.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3219,,
5200.099999999999,5202.98," So you have this perfect weapon,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7695,,
5202.98,5206.22, but also you have to have perfect strategy,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3976,,
5206.26,5210.7, and how to coordinate it and organize it and use it.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.526,,
5210.7,5214.22," And this is where the genius that I cannot explain at all,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6364,,
5214.22,5217.26, but the genius of Cengiz Han came in.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.327,,
5217.26,5220.66," Other people I think had been very good in earlier times,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.372,,
5220.66,5223.9400000000005," a number of Turkic leaders and also,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2469,,
5223.9400000000005,5225.5," or even Attila the Han,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2505,,
5225.5,5228.26," who of course was actually born in the West,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2549,,
5228.26,5232.66, but they were charismatic leaders and very dramatic leaders.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3412,,
5232.66,5234.740000000001, And it wasn't that they were so excellent,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3422,,
5234.74,5236.86, in their strategy.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4067,,
5236.86,5238.66, They were very good in warfare.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4755,,
5238.66,5240.3, And that's what carried him through.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2563,,
5240.3,5242.86," Cengiz Han's army was extremely good in warfare,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4388,,
5242.86,5244.66, but small.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.561,,
5244.66,5248.06," He never got probably above 100,000,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3683,,
5248.06,5250.42," at the most 110,000.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4734,,
5250.42,5251.94, That is small.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4906,,
5251.94,5253.78, When you're going against China,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2416,,
5255.26,5257.98," that has millions just in the army,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3715,,
5258.94,5259.98," not to count in the country,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2935,,
5259.98,5261.98," and you're going against Russia,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2767,,
5261.98,5263.66, and you're going against the Middle East,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3103,,
5263.66,5266.78," and Persia and Afghanistan and these areas,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4505,,
5268.06,5270.94, your whole army has to be as finely tuned,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5794,,
5270.94,5274.58," as each rider, each bow and each horse.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6543,,
5274.58,5275.78," That's the weapon,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3085,,
5275.78,5279.42," what the army becomes the super weapon of Cengiz Han,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7269,,
5279.42,5282.3, how he organized it and how he used it,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6015,,
5282.3,5284.78, and the strategies that he put together.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4275,,
5284.78,5288.7," Yeah, when you have a small army, just think about that.",SPEAKER_01,3,0.2873,,
5288.7,5293.26, A small army that conquered the world.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4219,,
5293.26,5296.3, It would fit in a stadium today in America.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3762,,
5298.38,5303.22," So there's extreme efficient coordination of units,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.4475,,
5303.22,5304.66," mostly cavalry, right?",SPEAKER_01,3,0.4254,,
5304.66,5305.5, All cavalry.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5084,,
5305.5,5306.34, It's all cavalry.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3001,,
5306.34,5310.46," He had no infantry and he had no baggage train,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3595,,
5310.46,5313.02," he had no backup commissary,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3499,,
5314.3,5315.9400000000005," early on no engineer corps,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3744,,
5315.9400000000005,5318.74," later one was added much later,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3585,,
5318.74,5320.62," but no, all cavalry.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3157,,
5320.62,5323.58, And so there's light cavalry and heavy cavalry,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3755,,
5323.58,5327.58," and breaking down units using the decimal system,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.2497,,
5327.58,5329.78," 10, 100, 1000.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.7708,,
5329.78,5333.82, So there's a kind of hierarchy,SPEAKER_01,3,0.5591,,
5333.82,5337.66," where you delegate authority,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.4937,,
5337.66,5341.14," but to the degree there's commands,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.5746,,
5341.14,5343.9, they must be followed strictly.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3265,,
5343.9,5347.22," So for like extremely efficient, accurate,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5658,,
5347.22,5352.22, precise deployment of these troops in the battlefield,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4725,,
5353.02,5355.26," and the dynamic movement of the troops,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.4501,,
5355.26,5358.58," including all the interesting tactics that were utilized,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5293,,
5358.58,5361.42, you have to have really good communication and coordination.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.4306,,
5361.42,5363.58, And for that orders must be followed.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3433,,
5363.58,5364.42, Yes.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2993,,
5365.42,5366.780000000001, Is there something to speak to that?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2921,,
5366.780000000001,5369.02, Like how do you tune this kind of system,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5329,,
5369.02,5371.7, to where everybody is working together so well?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.239,,
5371.7,5374.34, I think the first point is the extreme loyalty,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3417,,
5374.34,5377.1, of the people whom Cengiz Han chose.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4832,,
5377.9400000000005,5380.38," His kinsmen, as we said, had deserted him.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3139,,
5380.38,5384.22," His anda was a questionable relationship,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4069,,
5384.22,5388.38," but all the others that he found were just common people,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4383,,
5388.38,5390.3," herders or hunters, very common,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3626,,
5390.3,5391.820000000001, and they were loyal to him,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6368,,
5391.820000000001,5395.820000000001," and never ever revolted against him, never betrayed him.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6891,,
5395.820000000001,5397.660000000001, So he had extreme loyalty.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3924,,
5397.660000000001,5400.820000000001," And then as you mentioned, he organized his decimal system.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4877,,
5400.820000000001,5404.780000000001," So the smallest unit of the army was the arft,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3331,,
5405.74,5408.34, the squad of 10 men.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3185,,
5408.34,5410.54," They were put together and then the head of that squad,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4044,,
5410.54,5412.66," he had total control over it,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3272,,
5412.66,5416.06, but the men knew that they were going to protect each other,SPEAKER_00,3,0.423,,
5416.06,5421.06, and they had to come back with every member or everybody.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4578,,
5421.38,5423.58, You don't leave anybody behind.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5228,,
5423.58,5425.54, So this was extremely important.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4942,,
5425.54,5429.34," So if you submit to the orders of the man in charge,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4827,,
5429.34,5433.62, you know that he's risking his own life for you also.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2509,,
5433.66,5435.42, And you know that your brother on the left,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2254,,
5435.42,5438.58, and on the right is risking his life for you.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4159,,
5438.58,5443.02," The army was organized with five horses, each man.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3627,,
5443.02,5445.54," They had their bow and they had a lot of arrows,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3859,,
5445.54,5446.5," as many as they could have,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4434,,
5446.5,5450.7, but they also retrieved arrows at the end of their battle.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4034,,
5450.7,5453.38, And they also would retrieve the enemy arrows.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4045,,
5453.38,5455.22," This was a great advantage, by the way,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.45,,
5455.22,5456.5," when they hit Russia,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2929,,
5456.5,5459.5, because the Russians could not use Mongolian arrows.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3364,,
5459.5,5462.38," They could knock them in their bow,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3248,,
5462.38,5464.42, but the Mongols could use Russian arrows.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.426,,
5464.42,5467.42," But so all these little things,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3843,,
5467.42,5469.34, but it's not even just the arrow.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4528,,
5469.34,5473.02," Also, they had to carry needle and thread.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3611,,
5474.22,5477.1, Every soldier had to be able to sew.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3311,,
5477.1,5479.9800000000005, And sometimes that could be a torn garment.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3505,,
5479.9800000000005,5483.78, It could be a piece of skin or a wound that somebody has.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3341,,
5483.78,5485.54, It was a very odd thing when you think about,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4147,,
5485.54,5487.06, the army of Chinggis Khan,SPEAKER_00,4,0.331,,
5487.06,5488.78, and they're carrying everything themselves.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6429,,
5488.78,5490.86, They don't have any pack train behind them.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3355,,
5490.86,5492.62, And that one of the things they have to carry,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5517,,
5492.62,5495.98, is needle and thread in order to sew up things.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4097,,
5495.98,5498.299999999999, So complete self-reliance in that regard.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7485,,
5498.299999999999,5502.02," Yes, they also carried dried dairy products,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2602,,
5502.02,5505.219999999999," adult, it's called, with a dry curd.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3669,,
5505.219999999999,5507.7, And they can keep it for a couple of years even.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4376,,
5507.7,5509.74," But you dry it and then when you need it,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4829,,
5509.74,5512.38, you can put it in a flask of water.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3405,,
5512.38,5515.42," You ride all day, it juggles up and down, boom, boom, boom,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5637,,
5515.42,5518.299999999999, and turns into kind of thick protein.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4079,,
5518.3,5521.02, It said that the Mongols could easily go three to five days,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3095,,
5521.02,5523.38, without ever building a fire.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.456,,
5523.38,5524.820000000001, They had enough food there with.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3671,,
5524.820000000001,5526.9800000000005, So all these little things at the lowest level,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3234,,
5526.9800000000005,5531.14," were important, as well at the highest level of his loyalty,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6188,,
5531.14,5534.22," of his men to him, and it went all the way down.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4532,,
5534.22,5536.22, Loyalty was extremely important.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7131,,
5536.22,5540.34," And he organized the army into left wing, right wing,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4341,,
5540.34,5541.34, or east and west.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3685,,
5541.34,5544.820000000001," Mongols, the word for left is east,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2898,,
5544.820000000001,5547.62, the word for right is west.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.326,,
5547.62,5548.94, So those two wings.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4518,,
5548.94,5551.66," And then in the middle was the goal, the center,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3737,,
5551.66,5556.66, this moving center that was his bodyguard,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4807,,
5556.66,5558.26, and his unit in the middle.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3325,,
5559.3,5562.54, Then you see they'd have a vanguard and a rear guard.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3961,,
5562.54,5565.38, Sometimes the vanguard would go out as much as two years,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3992,,
5565.38,5568.3," in advance to clear the land, run the people away,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4305,,
5568.3,5572.099999999999," scare them, make them go away so that the grass is left there",SPEAKER_00,4,0.232,,
5572.099999999999,5574.54, for the army when it moves through.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3635,,
5574.54,5577.26, And they never marched the way other armies do,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3621,,
5577.26,5580.58, in a line of one following the other,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3825,,
5580.58,5583.860000000001, that would always go in long lines spread out in wings,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4266,,
5584.74,5589.1," so that each horse is on its own path, you could say,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3356,,
5589.1,5591.1, but all parallel together.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4619,,
5591.1,5595.06, So they had very precise ways of doing things.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4423,,
5595.06,5599.5," And this, I think, was the secret with him.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6082,,
5599.5,5604.5," And he used the best people, but he also,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3485,,
5605.3,5608.3, he was willing to train them as much as possible.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4559,,
5608.3,5611.7, He never punished them for what happened.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3503,,
5611.7,5614.74," So Shikihutu, for example, the supreme judge,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3548,,
5614.74,5617.42, he was command one time of a group in the battle,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3277,,
5617.42,5620.58," in Afghanistan and he lost the battle,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3277,,
5620.58,5623.62," which is very, very unusual for Mongols.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2492,,
5623.62,5626.58," So Chinggis Khan went out with him, said,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2963,,
5626.58,5629.18," okay, let's go to the battlefield together",SPEAKER_00,3,0.8049,,
5629.18,5630.46, and look it over.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3546,,
5630.46,5633.02," And you explained to me what you did,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6142,,
5633.06,5635.18, and then we will talk about it.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3551,,
5635.18,5637.3, So he was very thoughtful in the way,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4243,,
5637.3,5639.42, that he was training the people around him.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3675,,
5639.42,5640.780000000001, And they knew they weren't gonna be punished.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4015,,
5640.780000000001,5642.900000000001, It's not like these countries where the general comes back,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4082,,
5642.900000000001,5645.02, and gets executed because he lost.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4567,,
5645.02,5646.820000000001," No, Chinggis Khan knows every general",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3873,,
5646.820000000001,5650.38," is gonna try 100% and if they retreat, fine.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3117,,
5650.38,5651.9800000000005, They're saving Mongol lives.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5541,,
5651.9800000000005,5652.9400000000005, They know what to do.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.403,,
5652.9400000000005,5654.5, He respects that.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3771,,
5654.5,5658.14, So all these things like that fit together.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5246,,
5658.14,5661.18," But I think a part of it that was important for him,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5259,,
5662.18,5664.820000000001," so he had this base from step warfare already,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3917,,
5664.820000000001,5669.820000000001," the horse, the archery and how that all fit together.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6256,,
5669.820000000001,5674.740000000001, But he was very quick to embrace any kind,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4027,,
5674.740000000001,5677.900000000001, of other technology that he saw.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3367,,
5677.900000000001,5682.14," I think that sedentary armies, like sedentary civilizations,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3035,,
5682.14,5684.02, they get stuck in their ways.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.378,,
5684.02,5685.780000000001, This is how we do it.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7162,,
5685.780000000001,5687.58," And we're gonna make it a little faster,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4149,,
5687.58,5689.62," we're gonna make it a little bigger, a little stronger,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5261,,
5689.66,5691.62, but this is how we think.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3529,,
5691.62,5694.38, Chinggis Khan had no set way to think.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2871,,
5694.38,5698.3," And when he encountered the first walled cities around 1209,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2402,,
5698.3,5701.02," after founding his nation in 1206,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3448,,
5701.02,5702.82, he went out on these raids.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3251,,
5702.82,5705.62," And I really think they were raids, not wars at first.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2861,,
5705.62,5707.94, So he went into Tangut territory,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3353,,
5707.94,5710.22, of what's now Northwestern China,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3005,,
5710.22,5712.099999999999, in the upper reaches of the Yellow River.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2641,,
5712.099999999999,5713.34," So he went there and of course,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4598,,
5713.34,5715.22, the cities have walls around them.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3454,,
5715.22,5718.7, This is a man who's never encountered a wall in his life.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6089,,
5718.74,5720.82," Well, he did, but they were made out of felt.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5676,,
5720.82,5723.34," The walls around his tent are, you know, felt walls.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3922,,
5723.34,5725.42," Yeah, just imagine what it's like",SPEAKER_01,5,0.2842,,
5726.78,5729.42, for the first time in your life seeing a wall.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6799,,
5729.42,5730.26, Yes.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2993,,
5730.26,5732.34," When you come from the Mongolian steppe,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.302,,
5732.34,5736.98, where there's very few even natural wall-like things.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3813,,
5736.98,5738.02, Right.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3182,,
5738.02,5740.179999999999," Well, they have like the wall cliffs in some places,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4372,,
5740.179999999999,5742.099999999999," they're familiar with that and they could climb them,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.427,,
5742.099999999999,5743.98, but they don't have people at the top,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5122,,
5743.98,5745.38, shooting down the mountain.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2658,,
5745.38,5746.62, But on the...,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4399,,
5746.62,5748.900000000001," So he looked, but he looked at everything around him",SPEAKER_00,3,0.6155,,
5748.900000000001,5751.18," and he saw, okay, they have this river",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3894,,
5751.18,5752.5, and they have all these channels,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6393,,
5752.5,5754.86, and they're always moving water around.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4345,,
5754.86,5757.42," And like we said, for a Mongol,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.594,,
5757.42,5760.1, anything that moves is a potential weapon.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3241,,
5760.1,5762.9800000000005, Anything that doesn't move is a target.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.7163,,

5764.18,5767.54, you've got a standing non-moving wall.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2716,,
5767.54,5772.54," So he said, okay, the men are gonna dig a channel",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4988,,
5773.66,5775.18, and they're gonna bring down the wall,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2794,,
5775.18,5776.9400000000005, of the Tangut city.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3441,,
5776.9400000000005,5778.26," Well, they did it.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3884,,
5778.26,5780.58, And they didn't know exactly what they were doing,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3669,,
5780.58,5783.06, and the embankments weren't high enough,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4488,,
5783.06,5785.860000000001, and too much water came in from the Yellow River,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4774,,
5785.860000000001,5788.06, and actually flooded out the Mongol camp.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5099,,
5788.9400000000005,5790.66," But okay, it happened.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.7467,,
5790.66,5792.22, We learned that lesson.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4776,,
5792.22,5793.62, So we're gonna prove it.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5153,,
5793.62,5796.06, And that became a strategy that actually worked,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5642,,
5796.06,5800.34," for the Mongols for the next 50 years,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5006,,
5800.34,5801.700000000001, all the way to Baghdad.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4484,,
5801.700000000001,5803.62, They were able to use it when they conquered Baghdad,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3738,,
5803.62,5805.1, in 1258.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2419,,
5806.06,5810.780000000001, So this ability to see things and to try them.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.401,,
5810.780000000001,5813.38," And if they fail to try them in a different way,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3143,,
5813.38,5814.22," but a better way,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5271,,
5814.22,5816.46, we all think we learned from our mistakes.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5192,,
5816.46,5819.42," We all, yeah, yeah, I learned from that.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2881,,
5819.42,5820.46, And what do we do?,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5107,,
5820.46,5822.22, We repeat the mistake.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5105,,
5822.22,5824.14, I think it's just a part of human nature.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2479,,
5824.14,5826.02," Well, it didn't work the first eight times,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.425,,
5826.02,5827.38, but I'm gonna do it one more time.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4673,,
5827.38,5828.860000000001, I think it's gonna work.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3947,,
5828.860000000001,5831.14, I know I'm gonna win the lottery this time,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3253,,
5831.14,5832.620000000001, because I got the right.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3758,,
5832.620000000001,5834.38, That's how we think.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3555,,
5834.38,5838.54," But he had that real ability to first of all,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3138,,
5838.54,5840.82, to be humble before these other things,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3523,,
5840.82,5842.86, he didn't know about technology,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3328,,
5842.86,5845.38," and to understand that he didn't understand,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2703,,
5845.38,5849.22, but he could understand it in his own way.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4785,,
5849.22,5850.06, And he did.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3319,,
5850.06,5852.42, Over and over the Mongols were excellent,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5305,,
5852.42,5855.22, at putting together new things in new ways,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4736,,
5855.22,5857.82, and using them against their enemies.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4963,,
5857.82,5862.26, So rapid extreme continued innovation.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7286,,
5862.26,5864.02," So you couple that with a,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.4212,,
5865.900000000001,5869.26," I mean, you have to say a revolutionary idea",SPEAKER_01,3,0.2558,,
5869.26,5874.26, that promotion should be based on merit.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3494,,
5874.26,5877.900000000001, That idea combined with the innovative approach,SPEAKER_01,5,0.457,,
5877.900000000001,5882.900000000001," to the military, it just feeds on itself",SPEAKER_01,4,0.2794,,
5882.9800000000005,5885.26, because the people who are learning from their mistakes,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3209,,
5885.26,5888.22, and constantly improving are the ones that get promoted,SPEAKER_01,5,0.7136,,
5888.22,5889.38," in the positions of power,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.3772,,
5889.38,5891.900000000001, and then they inspire everybody else to do the same.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6009,,
5891.900000000001,5894.860000000001," And so it's just, if every action is judged",SPEAKER_01,3,0.4506,,
5894.860000000001,5897.620000000001," based on the excellence of that action,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.4645,,
5897.620000000001,5901.500000000001," then over time, repeated iteration in war",SPEAKER_01,2,0.3088,,
5901.500000000001,5905.26, creates a more and more powerful army.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.7016,,
5905.26,5907.3," Yes, yes.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3614,,
5907.3,5910.780000000001, And they were able to do that for three generations,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4527,,
5910.780000000001,5914.02," to create an army that was ever expanding,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5693,,
5914.02,5917.460000000001, ever changing its tactics and its technology.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7136,,
5917.460000000001,5920.540000000001, And they got worse at it over time.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4493,,
5921.38,5923.94, But Chinggis Han was the one who innovated it.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3751,,
5923.94,5925.1, He was the best with it.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6362,,
5925.1,5928.34," And he used to throughout his lifetime,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5106,,
5928.34,5930.98, and he was getting better over his lifetime,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2897,,
5930.98,5933.18," with using foreign information,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3616,,
5933.18,5935.66," foreign technology, foreign ideas.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.272,,
5937.7,5939.5, He just had a genius for that.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2782,,
5941.22,5942.7," If we can go back to the horses,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3037,,
5942.7,5945.22, you mentioned every soldier had five horses.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.4349,,
5945.22,5947.38, The reason for that is the horses get tired.,SPEAKER_01,2,0.3975,,
5947.38,5948.22, Yes.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2993,,
5948.22,5951.900000000001, And so you can cover a lot of ground in a single day.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3718,,
5951.900000000001,5952.740000000001, Yes.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2993,,
5952.740000000001,5955.22," Usually the way the rotation of the horses would,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4322,,
5955.22,5957.38, the horse would usually ride for one day,SPEAKER_00,3,0.351,,
5957.38,5960.38, and then rest for the next four to five days.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2551,,
5960.38,5963.22, And then another horse would be riding the next day.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3244,,
5963.22,5965.06," One way to measure it is that later,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4061,,
5965.06,5967.46," at the time of the death of a good day Han,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2664,,
5967.46,5972.46, the word went from Mongolia to Hungary in six weeks.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5674,,
5973.62,5975.7, Mongolia to Hungary in six weeks.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.3591,,
5975.7,5977.26, So let's just imagine this army,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3165,,
5977.26,5980.9400000000005, that's able to move at such high speeds,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2802,,
5980.9400000000005,5983.46, does not need to follow roads,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2633,,
5983.46,5986.3, because it's used to riding in the open step.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3582,,
5986.3,5990.26, So you can do all kinds of dynamic movements,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3453,,
5990.26,5991.900000000001, in encircling a place.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4557,,
5992.780000000001,5995.38, And then also one of the other famous things,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5321,,
5995.38,5998.5, is the feigned retreat that was used continuously.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4826,,
5998.5,6000.3, Can you explain how that worked?,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3674,,
6000.3,6004.3, The Mongols did not fight for honor,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3557,,
6004.3,6007.74," the way we often think of brave soldiers,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6209,,
6007.74,6010.9800000000005, Achilles and the Iliad and things like that.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4459,,
6010.9800000000005,6012.7, They fought for victory.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4909,,
6012.7,6013.9800000000005, That was the one thing.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4546,,
6013.9800000000005,6017.38," So to retreat, to save lives and all,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3739,,
6017.38,6019.14, there's no shame in that.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2557,,
6019.14,6021.62, So the Mongols would often retreat,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4096,,
6021.62,6023.54," and Chinggis Khan basically,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3091,,
6023.54,6026.26, he himself never fought a battle,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3774,,
6027.26,6029.54, that he thought he could lose.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3347,,
6029.54,6031.74, And he won every battle he fought.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.8621,,
6031.74,6033.78, That wasn't true for every general under him.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3706,,
6033.78,6035.74," As we said for Shigi Hutu, for example,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4003,,
6035.74,6039.02, but he won every battle because there was no shame,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3962,,
6039.02,6042.139999999999," in retreating and in not fighting, not engaging the enemy.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.6189,,
6042.139999999999,6045.06," However, that also becomes a tactic",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4775,,
6045.06,6047.139999999999, and that they would send in a small group,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2577,,
6047.139999999999,6048.82, of soldiers to attack.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.28,,
6048.82,6051.34," And the Mongols were able to fire, of course,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3226,,
6051.34,6053.66, going forward on the horse.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3789,,
6053.66,6058.66, They were able to then act like they were defeated,SPEAKER_00,4,0.256,,
6059.099999999999,6063.099999999999," and turn, but they could still fire backwards,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3966,,
6063.1,6065.780000000001," which was the Parthian shot, which is unusual in the world,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2945,,
6065.780000000001,6069.14," not totally unique, but unusual to fire backwards.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.6435,,
6069.14,6071.26, But the Mongols also could lean down,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4551,,
6071.26,6072.9400000000005, and fire under the neck of the horse.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5072,,
6072.9400000000005,6075.620000000001, So they're protected and they had many different ways.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4226,,
6075.620000000001,6078.38," So they're firing coming, they're firing going,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3908,,
6078.38,6081.660000000001, but usually the soldiers who were against them,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4893,,
6081.660000000001,6083.860000000001, would break ranks to chase them.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3462,,
6083.860000000001,6085.58," They want to go, they want to get their weapons,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3122,,
6085.58,6087.22, they want to kill the Mongols.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2485,,
6087.22,6089.42," And if they didn't immediately break ranks,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3151,,
6089.42,6092.54, the Mongols would often start throwing things out,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3418,,
6092.54,6095.62, like loot from someplace and valuables around.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.509,,
6095.62,6098.58, And the soldiers usually couldn't resist it.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4583,,
6098.58,6101.46," So they'd come chasing out after the Mongols,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4358,,
6101.46,6104.9, sort of pale male going in every different direction.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4861,,
6104.9,6107.34, And then they would get to a certain point,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4451,,
6107.34,6110.3," and from behind the two hills,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3898,,
6110.3,6113.1, the Mongol army would come and slaughter them.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2481,,
6114.06,6116.9, Over and over this tactic worked.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4026,,
6116.9,6118.06, It's like the one with the water.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.411,,
6118.06,6121.38," I'm thinking to people, how can they not know",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2637,,
6121.38,6122.82, this is what the Mongols are doing?,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3093,,
6122.82,6124.5, How can they not know that?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2808,,
6124.5,6126.46," Human nature, there's something that",SPEAKER_01,1,0.2668,,
6126.46,6128.54, when the forces are retreating.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3412,,
6128.54,6130.5," You want to follow them, you want to run after them.",SPEAKER_01,3,0.2529,,
6130.5,6131.66, You can't help it.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.3187,,
6131.66,6132.4800000000005," Yeah, yeah.",SPEAKER_01,1,0.2489,,
6132.4800000000005,6133.32, I don't know what that is.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3724,,
6133.32,6135.22," That's maybe the animalistic,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.4609,,
6135.22,6139.74, but take that with the ability at high speeds,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4192,,
6139.74,6144.1," for the Mongols to encircle and attack the flanks,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.3839,,
6144.1,6149.1, which there has been many great military historians,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2447,,
6149.780000000001,6153.860000000001, who have written about the great military forces,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4679,,
6153.860000000001,6155.06, throughout history.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5426,,
6155.06,6158.900000000001, And one of the things you write about in general,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6087,,
6158.900000000001,6163.34, is the Mongols don't get written about almost at all,SPEAKER_01,1,0.4953,,
6163.34,6168.22, and don't get credit for the military tactics,SPEAKER_01,2,0.3562,,
6168.22,6170.96, and the military genius exhibited,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6156,,
6170.96,6172.700000000001, through the different strategies.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4885,,
6172.700000000001,6174.9800000000005, This kind of idea of the feign retreat,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2406,,
6174.9800000000005,6177.02," and then attacking the flanks,",SPEAKER_01,2,0.2816,,
6177.02,6182.02," that's been, if not invented and perfected by Genghis.",SPEAKER_01,3,0.332,,
6183.9800000000005,6185.860000000001, He really was a military genius.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5374,,
6185.860000000001,6187.38, But there were other things too.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5154,,
6187.38,6189.580000000001, They didn't like roads.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4589,,
6189.580000000001,6191.22, They just didn't like the roads.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.5177,,
6191.22,6193.42, So they would often be coming from some direction,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5726,,
6193.42,6195.3, that nobody ever came from.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6897,,
6195.3,6198.02, And the people would be unprepared for that.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3377,,
6198.02,6201.42, The most famous example is probably in Bukhara.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2622,,
6201.42,6203.700000000001," This is a beautiful, wonderful old city,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.8884,,
6203.700000000001,6206.740000000001, a great place in the world to this day.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.8353,,
6207.179999999999,6209.139999999999, They came across the desert.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3231,,
6210.94,6212.86," Well, nobody had ever attacked across the desert.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.398,,
6212.86,6214.54, So people see dust coming.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4696,,
6214.54,6215.94," They think, oh, a caravan.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3195,,
6215.94,6217.9, They don't even know what's going on.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3189,,
6217.9,6220.9, But it was the direction that was a surprise element,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4746,,
6220.9,6222.78, in that particular case.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2584,,
6222.78,6224.42, So he was able to think in ways,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4414,,
6224.42,6226.86, that the other people were not thinking yet,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3528,,
6226.86,6228.86, and to be able to surprise them.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5119,,
6228.86,6231.3," What do you think it, again, felt like",SPEAKER_01,5,0.2697,,
6231.3,6235.219999999999," to have this Mongol armada, the horses,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.6574,,
6236.06,6237.780000000001," it must have, the ground must shake",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5104,,
6237.780000000001,6239.820000000001, when you have that many horses.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2615,,
6239.820000000001,6242.62, What do you think it feels like to be in a town,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3967,,
6242.62,6245.62, when Genghis Khan is approaching?,SPEAKER_01,2,0.257,,
6245.62,6249.34, I think the terror was one of the greatest weapons,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7307,,
6249.34,6251.1, that he had.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2659,,
6251.1,6255.5, That he cultivated this reputation of ferocity.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.691,,
6255.5,6257.5," Not only did he win battles,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2893,,
6257.5,6260.780000000001," but he didn't allow people to write about him, as we said,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3641,,
6260.780000000001,6263.54, but he encouraged refugees.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4051,,
6263.54,6264.62," And when he conquered a city,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3696,,
6264.62,6266.98, he always made sure there were plenty of refugees,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4107,,
6266.98,6268.06," to go to the next city,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.261,,
6268.06,6269.42, because it's going to weaken them.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3651,,
6269.42,6271.86, It's going to weaken their food supply.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4184,,
6271.86,6273.66, And they're going to terrorize the people,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3572,,
6273.66,6275.62, with tales of the millions of people,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4408,,
6275.62,6278.9, that the Mongols killed with their steel chiseled teeth,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3754,,
6278.9,6282.02, and eating children and all kinds of horrible tales.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.7526,,
6282.02,6284.02, Genghis Khan encouraged it.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4291,,
6284.02,6285.74," You know, this is propaganda.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.411,,
6285.74,6289.82, It's terrorism of a mental sort to weaken the enemy.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2892,,
6289.82,6291.54," And so when you hear,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3093,,
6292.38,6293.58," or even if you know they're coming,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2976,,
6293.58,6296.78," you see the dust, you hear the kind of roar",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2911,,
6296.78,6298.74, that comes with all those horses,SPEAKER_00,3,0.25,,
6298.74,6300.42," and the trembling of the earth,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4714,,
6300.42,6302.94, it must have been truly terrifying.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7728,,
6302.94,6304.9, So the psychological warfare,SPEAKER_00,3,0.407,,
6304.9,6307.38, was a part of the whole process.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4285,,
6307.38,6311.02," But as I understand, there was always an offer",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3622,,
6311.02,6314.38, for the towns and the territories being attacked,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3593,,
6314.38,6318.42, for them to surrender peacefully without the loss of life.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6034,,
6318.42,6319.26, Yes.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2993,,
6319.26,6324.26, And the alternative would be the near complete loss of life.,SPEAKER_01,2,0.3721,,
6324.34,6325.9400000000005, Can you speak to that?,SPEAKER_01,1,0.232,,
6325.9400000000005,6329.18," Genghis Khan had a precise system, exactly.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4584,,
6329.18,6332.18, He sent in envoys first to explain to the people,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2869,,
6332.18,6333.860000000001, a little bit about the Mongols.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3993,,
6333.860000000001,6335.780000000001, Already much was known.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3427,,
6335.780000000001,6338.780000000001," But to explain to them that if they surrendered,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3498,,
6338.780000000001,6340.9400000000005, all the lives would be spared,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2969,,
6340.9400000000005,6343.9400000000005, and they could continue in their professions.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3631,,
6343.9400000000005,6346.26, It's just that now the rulers would be the Mongols.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3478,,
6346.26,6347.780000000001, They would have to pay the taxes,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3473,,
6347.78,6350.099999999999," and usually it'd be the same taxes they'd paid before,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3459,,
6350.099999999999,6352.139999999999, but now they would go to the Mongols.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.367,,
6352.139999999999,6353.9, That was kind of the general system.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5922,,
6353.9,6356.3," And because you only have a hundred thousand soldiers,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2208,,
6356.3,6359.02, you can't leave a detachment there.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3849,,
6359.02,6361.66, So you're gonna leave the local people in charge,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3708,,
6361.66,6365.02, to run their country or their city or their area,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3986,,
6365.02,6367.34, the way they have done in the past.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5364,,
6367.34,6370.02, He was absolutely faithful to that.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7583,,
6370.02,6373.82," In one episode in the north of Persia, modern Iran,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3026,,
6373.82,6377.78," his son-in-law, Tokhtar, he violated that",SPEAKER_00,1,0.282,,
6377.78,6378.9, and was stealing and looting,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4198,,
6378.9,6380.66, for the people who had surrendered.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2624,,
6381.9,6386.54, Genghis Khan called him in and he stripped him of his rank,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4565,,
6386.54,6391.54," and he said, the next city, you go first as a common soldier.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2793,,
6392.78,6394.94, And of course he was killed in the next battle.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2613,,
6394.94,6396.98," I don't know the name of the daughter, unfortunately.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3864,,
6396.98,6398.219999999999, I've tried to figure that out.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3605,,
6398.219999999999,6400.9," But anyway, it was a close relative to him",SPEAKER_00,3,0.49,,
6400.900000000001,6403.820000000001, and he was killed in the next by violating this law.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5355,,
6403.820000000001,6405.500000000001, So that was the law.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3559,,
6405.500000000001,6409.580000000001," So then if the city fought and the Mongols won,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3697,,
6409.580000000001,6411.02, they did not kill everyone.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4342,,
6411.02,6414.14, What they did was they killed all the leaders.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4176,,
6414.14,6416.740000000001, They felt like the elite had not served them well.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4999,,
6416.740000000001,6418.620000000001, And they usually killed the army,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2297,,
6418.620000000001,6421.38, because they couldn't incorporate the army into their own.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3851,,
6421.38,6422.620000000001, The army had failed.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4157,,
6423.500000000001,6426.900000000001," But the one thing that they valued were all the artisans,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2991,,
6426.900000000001,6428.580000000001, everybody who had a skill.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3094,,
6428.62,6431.02, And that skill could be making a pot.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2861,,
6431.02,6433.7, It could be hammering out a metal plate.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3553,,
6433.7,6435.86, It can be weaving carpets.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3377,,
6435.86,6438.94, It can be translating or just reading and writing.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3543,,
6438.94,6441.5, Every person with a skill was spared.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6181,,
6443.02,6445.9, So the killing of the people who were defeated,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3163,,
6445.9,6447.78, wasn't so severe.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4473,,
6447.78,6450.62, What was truly severe was if you surrendered.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.623,,
6451.5,6452.58, And many of them did.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3379,,
6452.58,6454.66, And then they knew they would not be harmed.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2852,,
6454.66,6455.5, So they're not harmed.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.48,,
6455.5,6456.34, The Mongols go on.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3517,,
6456.34,6458.58, The Mongols are hundreds of miles away.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2418,,
6458.58,6460.9400000000005," And all of a sudden, forget about the Mongols.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3241,,
6460.9400000000005,6462.74, Genghis Khan said word that we're supposed to send,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5105,,
6462.74,6464.78, so many cows or sheep to help.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.351,,
6464.78,6466.14, Forget about the Mongols.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3301,,
6466.14,6467.3, They're far away.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2853,,
6467.3,6468.46, It's a removal.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.277,,
6468.46,6470.7," No, he stopped.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.6004,,
6470.7,6472.38, He returned.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5393,,
6472.38,6475.9400000000005, He conquered the city and he killed everyone.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5286,,
6475.9400000000005,6477.22, That's the way it worked.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4744,,
6477.22,6481.14, So the most drastic slaughter happens,SPEAKER_01,1,0.4584,,
6481.14,6484.26, when there's an agreement and then betrayal.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.381,,
6484.26,6485.1, Yes.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2993,,
6485.740000000001,6488.14," As it turned out, I would say it was more the Middle East",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4513,,
6488.14,6491.700000000001, or what we call around Iran and Afghanistan,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2596,,
6491.700000000001,6494.22, where these were the worst cases.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.7764,,
6494.22,6498.700000000001, And I would say only in Afghanistan,SPEAKER_00,3,0.277,,
6498.700000000001,6501.3, did sometimes the emotion of the slaughter,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4324,,
6503.1,6505.1, take over in an unfortunate way.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3219,,
6505.1,6509.26, But he had a grandson whom he loved very much.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3761,,
6509.26,6511.22, And that grandson traveled with him.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.538,,
6511.22,6513.700000000001, And he had the happy childhood,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5337,,
6513.7,6516.139999999999, that Temujin had not had.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2618,,
6516.139999999999,6519.34, And I think Genghis Khan just loved that about him.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5199,,
6519.34,6521.7," But in Afghanistan, he was sent off",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3071,,
6521.7,6524.5, to conquer the Valley of Bamiyan,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4537,,
6524.5,6526.82, where the great Buddhas are actually.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5209,,
6526.82,6531.82," He was sent to Bamiyan and as it says in the Persian history,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3061,,
6532.46,6537.46, the thumb of fate fired the arrow that shot him down.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6788,,
6540.139999999999,6541.179999999999, He was killed.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5728,,
6541.9800000000005,6546.9800000000005," And for Genghis Khan, he had never lost a family member.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4235,,
6547.58,6551.14," Not one, none of his sons, none of his grandsons in battle.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.6279,,
6551.14,6552.54, He had not lost them.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2448,,
6552.54,6556.14," And now to lose the most valuable grandson you have,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7796,,
6556.14,6560.14, the one that's your pride and joy in so many ways.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.8921,,
6560.14,6563.54," And so he called the father, his own son to him",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4123,,
6564.900000000001,6568.700000000001," and did not tell him, he did not announce it to the public.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.6285,,
6568.7,6571.3, And the son came and the son didn't know,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2622,,
6571.3,6572.42, why he was being summoned.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2765,,
6572.42,6574.179999999999," And Genghis Khan said,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2944,,
6576.179999999999,6581.179999999999, you have to tell me that you will not cry or moan,SPEAKER_00,5,0.303,,
6583.5,6588.179999999999," when I tell you this, but your son is no more.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2534,,
6590.54,6593.62," And the father was, no one was allowed to moan.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3757,,
6593.62,6595.46, No one was allowed to cry.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6164,,
6595.46,6597.78, No one was allowed to do anything.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6888,,
6597.82,6602.82," You just, he said, make them cry.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2699,,
6604.42,6608.179999999999," You know, he came down on the people of Afghanistan",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3108,,
6609.86,6613.9," so harshly and it went on for weeks and weeks,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4632,,
6613.9,6616.74, the killing in Afghanistan.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3684,,
6616.74,6620.06, And then it just kind of wore itself out.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.422,,
6620.06,6623.46, He recognized that he had allowed his emotions,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3631,,
6623.46,6625.54, to overcome practicality,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3387,,
6625.54,6628.94, and that slaughtering of these people should stop.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4537,,
6628.94,6629.78, And so he did.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3235,,
6629.78,6631.42, But that's the only time I know of,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3826,,
6631.42,6635.86, that he really kind of lost control of his own emotions.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4287,,
6635.86,6638.22," And it's something we can all understand,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6349,,

6641.78,6644.42," we will not cry, we will not mourn.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.584,,
6644.42,6647.22," They will cry, they will mourn.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5846,,
6647.22,6652.22, So that goes against the cold rational way,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4089,,
6653.22,6658.22," he approached war, which is peace is offered",SPEAKER_01,4,0.2892,,
6659.7,6661.66, and then betrayal is punished.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.3941,,
6661.66,6663.66," I should add, he did not slaughter the people",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3177,,

6672.26,6675.9400000000005, the killing of him revitalized a lot of people's hopes,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3661,,
6675.9400000000005,6677.820000000001, and a lot of cities revolted.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5001,,

6680.3,6682.78," But the cities who revolted, he killed them all.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2957,,
6682.78,6684.66, There was a mass slaughter.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5751,,
6684.66,6687.34, There are estimates that Chinggis Khan,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3118,,
6687.34,6690.06, and his Mongol empire were responsible,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4674,,
6690.06,6693.900000000001," for an estimated 40 million deaths,",SPEAKER_01,1,0.4897,,

6696.9400000000005,6699.78," So to put this number in the perspective of the modern day,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.3256,,
6699.78,6702.02, that would be equivalent to killing,SPEAKER_01,3,0.408,,
6702.02,6704.820000000001, about 800 million people in today's population.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2251,,
6705.7,6708.3, So how should we think about the brutality,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3419,,
6708.3,6711.22, of numbers like these?,SPEAKER_01,2,0.3298,,
6711.22,6713.46, The number itself is difficult to deal with.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4149,,

6724.9400000000005,6729.62, And there was tremendous loss of life as in every war.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5708,,
6729.62,6733.9800000000005, I don't think we should judge him any differently,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4435,,

6745.74,6747.3, we should be able to understand,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4106,,

6856.3,6860.02," So one is just the very nature of war,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.2611,,

6923.02,6926.42, can we also criticize Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great,SPEAKER_01,3,0.247,,

6964.860000000001,6967.02, So he had a lot of interesting ideas there.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.5743,,

6973.9400000000005,6977.22, but also paved the way for new developments and progress.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.4881,,
6978.54,6980.82, Basically making this complicated case,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3867,,

6983.02,6984.22, paves the way for progress.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4451,,
6984.22,6986.42, So what do you think about this idea?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3287,,
6986.42,6987.66," Creative destruction,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.6037,,

6997.46,7000.9800000000005, Or we can destroy relationships that we're in,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2195,,

7006.02,7009.14, it does become a little bit more difficult.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.6951,,
7009.14,7013.9800000000005, I certainly think that these episodes create great changes.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5522,,
7013.9800000000005,7015.66, You can see great changes that happen,SPEAKER_00,5,0.475,,
7015.66,7018.3, because of the Mongol Empire.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.245,,
7018.3,7021.14," Now, whether or not that's a good reason",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3605,,
7021.14,7024.22," for the Mongol Empire having happened,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3336,,
7024.22,7027.5, it seems like a bit of a stretch for me.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5711,,
7029.66,7032.5, The Mongols helped to unify many countries.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5107,,
7032.5,7035.9800000000005," You can think Korea had been three, basically, kingdoms,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3614,,

7037.38,7039.22, Everything that you see in China today,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6759,,
7039.22,7041.02, was a part of the Mongol Empire.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2236,,
7041.02,7043.66," They put together North China, South China,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3176,,

7054.18,7057.7, and the center had been into Ukraine and Kiev.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.31,,
7057.7,7059.82, They shifted the focus out of Ukraine,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3279,,

7062.26,7064.900000000001, and they began the process of the unification,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4629,,
7064.900000000001,7067.22, and had a great impact on the country.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6634,,
7067.22,7070.1," So, in a way, it's a new creation.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4578,,

7074.14,7075.900000000001, where does the destruction come from?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4205,,
7075.900000000001,7078.62, It often comes because the powers around them,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4902,,
7078.62,7083.06, have been so debilitated and so corrupted,SPEAKER_00,1,0.634,,
7083.06,7088.06, and so decayed of their own lack of moral fiber,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4745,,
7088.74,7091.78, that it was easy to conquer them.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3211,,

7110.66,7111.9800000000005, I think that there are times,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4147,,
7114.18,7117.82," that people are going to do it for their own protection,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3536,,
7117.82,7120.46," if nothing else, of their family,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3054,,
7120.46,7123.38, and it's justified in that sense to themselves.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2611,,
7123.38,7125.9800000000005," It may not be justified in a world sense,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4353,,
7125.9800000000005,7130.34, but I just make the case for being tolerant,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4441,,
7130.34,7131.5, of what the Mongols did,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4332,,
7131.5,7134.1, if we can tolerate what the Americans did.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2721,,
7134.1,7135.82," And I am American, true and true.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7996,,
7135.82,7138.179999999999, There's no question about that.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2957,,
7138.179999999999,7141.78, But we overlook all of our things that we did.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4027,,
7141.78,7144.74," That's interesting, for example, in Afghanistan.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4556,,
7144.74,7146.74, We were there for some 20 years.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4776,,
7146.74,7149.34," We had made the Taliban stronger before,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2773,,
7149.34,7151.02," when they were fighting against the Russians,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2659,,
7151.02,7154.139999999999," and then we kicked them out, and then they kicked us out.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4848,,
7154.139999999999,7157.78," But some of the Taliban leaders are from the Jadran clan,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4371,,
7157.78,7162.78," the descended from Jamuk family, from his clan.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2799,,
7163.62,7167.46, This is what I mean when I say that the ramifications,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2862,,
7167.46,7171.9," from that time are still with us, and we don't even see it.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3066,,
7172.9,7175.46, And when Saddam Hussein went on television,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2853,,
7175.46,7179.78," for the last time in Iraq to plead with his people,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4846,,
7179.78,7182.5," he said, the Mongols, meaning Americans,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.317,,
7182.5,7186.82," the Mongols have returned, the Mongols have returned.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4235,,
7186.82,7189.38," And he said, the Americans are just the new Mongols.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3198,,
7189.66,7192.78, And I can see it.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4991,,
7192.78,7197.34," I don't accept it, but I can see how people think.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3804,,
7197.34,7199.22, If we can be honest with ourselves,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2692,,
7199.22,7202.46," and strip away our own lies about ourselves,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5522,,
7202.46,7204.3, then perhaps we will be more ethical,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5574,,
7204.3,7206.1, in our dealings with other people.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4518,,
7207.26,7209.42, And there's effects that you could talk about.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3806,,
7209.42,7212.22," I mean, the unification of China, Mongols or otherwise,",SPEAKER_01,2,0.2545,,
7212.22,7215.46, is a very important step in the history of China,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6562,,
7215.46,7218.58, that permeates to today.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4705,,
7218.62,7220.7," And then there's a lot of stuff that we'll talk about,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.356,,
7220.7,7223.9," the ideas of religious freedom, the postal network,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.3281,,
7223.9,7226.3," the trade routes, all of this.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.4344,,
7226.3,7229.58, There's a lot of progressive consequences,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4722,,
7229.58,7234.019999999999, of the Mongol conquest and the Mongol empire.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4188,,
7234.019999999999,7235.62," We'll talk about that, but let's linger",SPEAKER_01,3,0.4565,,
7235.62,7238.82, on the heavier topic for a little bit longer.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.5855,,
7238.82,7240.74," Like we were talking about Dan Carlin,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.3877,,
7240.74,7245.74," he was critical of your work a little bit,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.4236,,
7246.74,7249.34," showing it respect, but also a little bit critical",SPEAKER_01,4,0.5733,,
7249.34,7252.34, as being a bit too emphasizing and focusing,SPEAKER_01,3,0.5783,,
7257.019999999999,7260.46," a lot on the positive impacts, correctly and accurately,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.5391,,
7260.46,7264.66, but not giving enough air time or describing,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4859,,
7264.66,7269.66," the brutality of the killing, the hell that is war.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.3846,,
7270.019999999999,7272.78, So can you understand his criticism?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3367,,
7272.78,7274.66," Guilty, I'm guilty.",SPEAKER_01,1,0.7395,,
7274.7,7275.54, Steel man.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5374,,
7277.3,7278.62, Carlin's a very smart man.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.575,,
7278.62,7281.62, I respect him very much and I like him tremendously.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.771,,
7281.62,7286.019999999999," And he's right, but that is not what I want to stress.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.6225,,
7286.019999999999,7289.3, It's not that I want to deny the killing.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3369,,
7289.3,7291.82," It's not that I want to deny the warfare,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3964,,
7291.82,7294.099999999999, but that's pretty much the same everywhere in the world.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5589,,
7294.099999999999,7296.7, And how much do we need to say about,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4998,,
7298.3,7303.3," how the wall was broken down, how this unit was defeated?",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4186,,
7303.58,7306.46," No, it's what comes afterwards.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3495,,
7306.46,7309.46, Just as the story of our life begins far earlier,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4532,,
7309.46,7311.860000000001," than we are born, the story of our life",SPEAKER_00,5,0.602,,
7311.860000000001,7314.42, goes on for a long time afterwards.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3965,,
7314.42,7317.58, If you have a nation of 1 million people,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3058,,
7318.54,7323.54," and you are ruling over hundreds of millions of people,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5547,,
7323.58,7325.58," hundreds of millions of people,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4886,,
7325.58,7328.18," China, Russia, the Middle East,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3304,,
7328.18,7330.58, you do not do that through warfare.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2395,,
7330.58,7332.74," You conquer them initially through warfare,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3087,,
7332.74,7335.139999999999, but you do not rule them through warfare.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3983,,
7335.139999999999,7337.86," You've got to be offering something that they want,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3625,,
7337.86,7339.219999999999, something that they like.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4555,,
7339.219999999999,7341.54, And all the things you've mentioned,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7166,,
7341.54,7344.099999999999," from the trading system, the postal system,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3877,,
7344.099999999999,7346.059999999999," the religious freedom, the rights of women,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3928,,
7346.059999999999,7347.9," the rights of minorities,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3074,,
7347.9,7351.139999999999, these were things that people responded to.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5817,,
7351.139999999999,7354.62, And so the world benefited tremendously,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6923,,
7355.54,7357.3, from the life of Chinggis Khan.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4431,,
7357.3,7359.98," But all we want to talk about, and I don't deny it,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.375,,
7359.98,7361.82, is the conquest part.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5074,,
7361.82,7363.86," Okay, that's 20 years.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.7336,,
7363.86,7366.34," If it went on for another 150 years,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3219,,
7367.38,7370.139999999999, there's more to the story than just conquest.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3546,,
7370.139999999999,7373.82," And there is a point that you correctly identify,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3865,,
7373.82,7376.46," and you've also written about Native Americans and so on,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.4278,,
7376.46,7381.46," that history does seem to be written by the non-barbarians,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3548,,
7382.099999999999,7386.059999999999," but in reality, history is not divided in this kind of way",SPEAKER_01,3,0.4561,,
7386.059999999999,7388.82," and the barbarians are not these crude,",SPEAKER_01,2,0.3945,,
7388.82,7391.5," brutal, plain, simple people",SPEAKER_01,5,0.2656,,
7391.54,7394.54," that there is a sophisticated, deep culture",SPEAKER_01,5,0.4395,,
7394.54,7396.18, within them as well.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3626,,
7396.18,7400.22, All the different kinds of peoples that came from the steppe.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5898,,
7400.22,7401.18, Yes.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2993,,
7401.18,7403.54, I guess if there's one thing that I try to do,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3984,,
7403.54,7405.34," in my career of writing,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5483,,
7405.34,7408.54, it is to get us to recognize the importance,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4359,,
7408.54,7411.02, of tribal people in the history of the world.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.481,,
7411.02,7413.26, We tend to have two categories for them.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5424,,
7413.26,7416.7," There are barbarians who kill people and eat one another,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2463,,
7416.7,7419.14, or they're victims and we should feel sorry for them,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4135,,
7419.14,7421.5, and nostalgic about everything about them,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5944,,
7421.5,7424.42, and maybe wear some of their beads or some of their clothing,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4055,,
7424.42,7428.06, to show how much we sympathize with their suffering.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4296,,
7428.06,7430.58, That's the two roles for tribal people.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3988,,
7430.58,7432.98, But I'm trying to show them in a different light,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5395,,
7432.98,7435.900000000001," that they conquered, yes, they were conquered,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2916,,
7435.900000000001,7438.22, but they also created great things,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4159,,
7438.22,7440.06, in the history of the world.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4875,,
7440.06,7442.58, And that the Mongol Empire was really,SPEAKER_00,5,0.243,,
7442.58,7444.98, the first modern empire in the way,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5239,,
7444.98,7447.38, that I'm putting together that story.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4933,,
7447.46,7450.78," And Chinggis Khan was the genius behind that,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.54,,
7450.78,7455.34, who created this idea that there could be one world,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2655,,
7455.34,7457.82," in which there would be one set of supreme law,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3192,,
7457.82,7460.18, but all people could follow their own law.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3474,,
7460.18,7462.46," You could have any religion you wanted,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2267,,
7462.46,7464.74, but ultimately you had to obey kind of,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5573,,
7464.74,7466.62, the great ethics of the sky.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7238,,
7466.62,7469.62, And there were things like that about his vision,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3467,,
7470.86,7475.66, that I think very few people in history had a vision.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3052,,
7475.7,7478.019999999999," And I look around the world today,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5678,,
7478.019999999999,7483.019999999999," and in my lifetime since the time of Roosevelt's death,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7918,,
7483.54,7487.42," I look around, I don't see much vision.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4908,,
7487.42,7491.86," I see lots of slogans, lots of talks, policy papers.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3801,,
7491.86,7493.86," Oh my God, we can produce it.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7065,,
7495.26,7497.019999999999, Where's the vision?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3213,,
7497.019999999999,7498.7," It's always, we're gonna have peace",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6469,,
7498.7,7499.78, and we're gonna have a better life,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2719,,
7499.78,7502.62, and vote for me or vote for my party.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.368,,
7502.62,7504.9, And we're really for the people,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5854,,
7504.98,7508.98," and we're, what the heck are they talking about?",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2459,,
7508.98,7510.98, There is no vision there.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4552,,
7510.98,7512.22, So what is this country?,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2433,,
7512.22,7513.38, What should this country be?,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2816,,
7513.38,7514.3, What is this world?,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4228,,
7514.3,7515.18, How should we?,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4031,,
7515.18,7516.740000000001," No, no vision.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.6421,,
7516.740000000001,7519.94," Well, those figures, I mean, they're rare through history.",SPEAKER_01,4,0.3095,,
7519.94,7522.700000000001," The legendary figures that come along that have vision,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.7052,,
7522.700000000001,7527.700000000001, but are able to capture the public imagination,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4128,,
7528.02,7530.22," and hearts and minds with the vision,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5731,,
7530.22,7534.94, but also have the skill to execute and implement it,SPEAKER_01,4,0.4705,,
7534.94,7537.3, and all of those things combined,SPEAKER_01,5,0.631,,
7537.3,7541.34, and have the mental fortitude not to be corrupted,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4579,,
7541.34,7544.22," by success along the way, all of those things.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.6257,,
7544.22,7546.3, That's very rare in history.,SPEAKER_01,2,0.2846,,
7546.3,7547.58," And when they come along,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.3217,,
7547.58,7549.66, they change the direction of history.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3353,,
7549.66,7554.66," If we could linger on some of these world-defining ideas,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.2698,,
7554.7,7559.7," religious freedom is, it's just surprising",SPEAKER_01,5,0.4214,,
7560.46,7565.46," and incredible that Genghis Khan was able to enforce,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.8127,,
7566.54,7569.780000000001, inspire the value of religious freedom,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4957,,
7569.780000000001,7571.7, throughout all of these disparate lands,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2739,,
7571.7,7575.06, for whom religion was a very powerful force.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3417,,
7575.06,7576.54, So can you speak to that?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3267,,
7576.54,7579.1, Some empires in history and some rulers,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4039,,
7579.1,7581.740000000001, have been tolerant of various groups.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2709,,
7581.740000000001,7584.1," I mean, Rome to some extent was reasonably tolerant",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4227,,
7584.1,7586.1," of different sects and religions,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3659,,
7586.1,7588.7," not of the Christians, but reasonably.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5333,,
7588.7,7591.62," But what happened with Genghis Khan,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.31,,
7592.66,7596.139999999999, the first campaign he had outside of Mongolia,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3616,,
7596.139999999999,7599.34, was for the Uyghur people who lived in Western China.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3046,,
7599.34,7602.139999999999," They at that time were being ruled by,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3215,,
7602.139999999999,7605.9, actually we had mentioned before the Niman King Tayang Khan.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2712,,
7605.9,7610.9," His son, Guxluk, had fled, no good worthless son,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.7227,,
7612.22,7617.22, but Guxluk had fled into what is today the area,SPEAKER_00,3,0.355,,
7617.38,7622.38, around Kyrgyzstan and they ruled over the Uyghur people.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2261,,
7622.66,7625.740000000001," He had been a Christian, the Niman had been a Christian tribe,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2967,,
7625.740000000001,7627.46, but he converted to Buddhism.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3583,,
7627.46,7629.58," Well, his subjects were Muslim",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3093,,
7629.58,7631.62, and he outlawed the Muslim religion,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4393,,
7631.62,7633.860000000001, and he made all kinds of things happen.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.653,,
7633.860000000001,7637.18, So the Uyghurs sent a delegation to Genghis Khan.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3759,,
7637.18,7639.94," At this time, they knew that the emperors of China",SPEAKER_00,3,0.283,,
7639.94,7641.34," were too weak to protect them,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.5115,,
7641.34,7643.22, so they sent delegation to Genghis Khan,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3466,,
7643.22,7646.5, and asked him to come and save them from him.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3613,,
7646.5,7649.18," And he did, he sent down a detachment,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2862,,
7649.18,7650.26," he didn't actually go himself,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4239,,
7650.26,7651.9, he sent the detachment down there.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3195,,
7651.9,7653.5," They drove Guxluk from power,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.337,,
7653.5,7658.02, Guxluk fled down towards Pakistan in that direction.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4895,,
7658.02,7659.74," They caught up with him, they killed him.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3119,,
7659.74,7662.14, That's what the Mongols did.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3207,,
7662.14,7665.22, And then Genghis Khan made the first law,SPEAKER_00,5,0.276,,
7665.22,7668.34, that he ever made for people outside of Mongolia.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7234,,
7668.34,7671.02," So up to this point, it's been tribal law.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2685,,
7671.02,7673.54," And he saw, as we mentioned before,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5242,,
7673.54,7676.06," that for the tribes were mostly fighting over women,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4335,,
7676.06,7678.26," so you outlaw the kidnapping of women,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2184,,
7678.26,7679.780000000001," you outlaw the sale of women,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3204,,
7679.780000000001,7682.580000000001, and you cut down on a lot of the feuding.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4174,,
7682.580000000001,7685.46," But he saw that civilized, quote unquote,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2917,,
7685.46,7688.900000000001, people fought a lot over religion.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3462,,
7688.900000000001,7689.94," They weren't fighting over women,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3631,,
7689.94,7691.38, they were fighting over religion.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3557,,
7691.38,7693.660000000001, And so he made the law.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3778,,
7693.660000000001,7695.46, Now this was very interesting.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5448,,
7695.46,7696.620000000001, We talk about religious freedom.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3589,,
7696.620000000001,7699.38, Religious freedom comes in many forms.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.336,,
7699.38,7704.38, One form is to allow institutions to do what they want.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3589,,
7704.74,7709.02, So we're gonna allow the Mormons and the Catholics,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3521,,
7709.02,7711.62, and the Jews and the Muslims each to do what they want,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5302,,
7711.62,7714.58, in the organized churches that they have.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4876,,
7714.58,7715.98, His law was not that.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3357,,
7715.98,7718.02," It had presumed that, it allowed that.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3686,,
7718.02,7721.22, But he said every person has the right,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3105,,
7721.22,7723.34, to choose their religion.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3408,,
7723.34,7727.22," No one can stop them, no one can force them.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4179,,
7727.22,7729.5," The idea that it was individual choice,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2838,,
7729.5,7731.98," no one in history had ever thought of that,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2822,,
7731.98,7733.78, that it belonged to the person.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3411,,
7734.019999999999,7736.58," That's a really, really powerful statement.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.3171,,
7736.58,7739.099999999999," That alone, that's why you talk about Thomas Jefferson",SPEAKER_01,3,0.2449,,
7739.099999999999,7742.38, being deeply inspired by Genghis Khan.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5105,,
7745.059999999999,7747.099999999999," Religious freedom, yes, of the individual,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.3012,,
7747.099999999999,7751.42," but it's such a powerful illustration,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.3819,,
7751.42,7754.7," manifestation of just individual freedom, period.",SPEAKER_01,1,0.2405,,
7755.62,7759.94," If you in the world, in history,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.3624,,
7759.94,7763.54," are allowed to practice any religion you want,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.463,,
7764.62,7769.62," that's, I mean, that is like one of the biggest way",SPEAKER_01,2,0.3639,,
7770.019999999999,7772.099999999999, to say that the individual is fundamentally free,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3199,,
7772.099999999999,7773.38, in this society.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5689,,
7773.38,7776.94," Yes, there was a great source of power for him also.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.4933,,
7776.94,7778.74," You know, I don't say that he did this",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2546,,
7778.74,7781.139999999999, because of some ideological reason.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3944,,
7781.139999999999,7783.78, It's just like he didn't outlaw the kidnapping of women,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2659,,
7783.78,7785.139999999999, for ideological reasons.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3711,,
7785.139999999999,7788.259999999999, He didn't come to it through studying ideas of moral right.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4545,,
7788.259999999999,7790.54, He came to it through practical experience of life.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4477,,
7790.54,7793.98," His mother was kidnapped, his wife was kidnapped.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3385,,
7793.98,7797.54, He knew that that was a crime against every ethics,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5028,,
7797.54,7800.1, that you can think of and every form of morality.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6495,,
7800.1,7801.22, That's why he did it.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3129,,
7801.22,7803.94," Not for ideological reasons, but practical reasons.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4757,,
7803.94,7806.18," It hurt people, it hurt people.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2835,,
7806.18,7808.42, It was the same with religion.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3015,,
7808.42,7810.26, He gave this right to everybody,SPEAKER_00,5,0.64,,
7810.26,7813.18, because it was gonna be their own personal right,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2593,,
7813.18,7815.26, to keep them from being hurt.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4197,,
7815.26,7817.66, And then that gave him tremendous support,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5733,,
7817.66,7820.099999999999, from minorities of many types.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2235,,
7821.34,7822.9, And so they flocked to him.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3674,,
7822.9,7825.86," Minorities, after that, this was a minority effort",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3744,,
7825.86,7827.98, of the Muslim Uyghurs to come to him.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3482,,
7827.98,7830.62," Many people flocked to him for the same reason,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3685,,
7830.62,7832.82, for that kind of religious freedom.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2967,,
7832.82,7834.019999999999, So that religious freedom,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3195,,
7834.019999999999,7835.74," and also the other things you mentioned,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.493,,
7835.74,7837.38, they create a stable society.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4406,,
7837.38,7842.22, And that allows him with a small army,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3895,,
7842.22,7844.98, to administer a large empire.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4436,,
7845.02,7848.1," And also I will say in a more practical,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3835,,
7848.1,7850.26," political sort of way of thinking,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.354,,
7850.26,7854.1, he recognized the power of having a balance of power,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4941,,
7854.1,7856.820000000001," of like Shiite and Sunni,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2879,,
7856.820000000001,7860.660000000001, that both are gonna be allowed equal rights.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2343,,
7860.660000000001,7862.540000000001, One is not dominant over the other.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4225,,
7862.540000000001,7866.1," And Christians and Jews, they all have,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5208,,
7866.1,7871.1," well, that keeps the society from fragmenting against him",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3895,,
7871.900000000001,7873.500000000001, or uniting against him.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3748,,
7873.54,7875.86, And it's a kind of fragmentation,SPEAKER_00,3,0.535,,
7875.86,7877.62, that he's taken advantage of.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4119,,
7877.62,7879.26," I don't think that was his main reason,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4299,,
7879.26,7881.58," but I do think he was quite aware of that,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5872,,
7881.58,7883.54, that you give every religion the right.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6557,,
7884.74,7889.54," Unfortunately, the only religion he didn't recognize",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3859,,
7889.54,7892.26, as a religion was Confucianism.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2424,,
7892.26,7893.66," He said, what do they do?",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3008,,
7894.9,7896.98, The Taoists can do magic on the earth,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4237,,
7896.98,7899.86, and they can give people magic formulas,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5623,,
7899.86,7903.02, and they have all this kind of stuff going on.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.534,,
7903.02,7904.34," Well, what did the Confucianist do?",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2472,,
7904.34,7907.580000000001," So still the people could be Confucianist, that was okay,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.6061,,
7907.580000000001,7910.98, but he didn't expend all the tax-free rights.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.36,,
7910.98,7911.860000000001," See, that was another thing,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2644,,
7911.860000000001,7916.540000000001," he dropped all taxes on religious institutions, all types,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5477,,
7916.540000000001,7921.26, but since the Confucianists were not necessarily classified.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4888,,
7921.26,7924.620000000001," But then of course, eventually that was abused so much",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3806,,
7924.620000000001,7926.620000000001," because the religions were then,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2901,,
7926.620000000001,7928.540000000001," again, everybody didn't own a property,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5215,,
7928.540000000001,7930.46," you can still use it, you can still farm your land,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.464,,
7930.46,7932.98," but it's ours and now you don't have to pay taxes on it,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3442,,
7933.820000000001,7936.06," you can just give us some money, you know, got abused,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4109,,
7936.06,7937.820000000001, but it started off as a good idea.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4587,,
7939.1,7941.94," And genuinely, as I understand, maybe you can correct me,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5178,,
7943.1,7947.34," of course, there's the practical aspect of those policies,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.4676,,
7947.34,7949.3, but he himself was just curious,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4774,,
7949.3,7953.22," about the different religions as well, as I understand.",SPEAKER_01,4,0.4513,,
7953.22,7956.42, So he never chose any religion,SPEAKER_01,1,0.3256,,
7956.42,7959.820000000001," except the one from which he came, I guess.",SPEAKER_01,3,0.424,,
7959.820000000001,7962.02," I mean, can you describe",SPEAKER_01,3,0.2831,,
7962.02,7965.700000000001, what he believed spiritually himself?,SPEAKER_01,1,0.3247,,
7965.700000000001,7968.340000000001," It's interesting, you know, we said after the death",SPEAKER_00,4,0.412,,
7968.340000000001,7970.98," of Sirimon, his grandson in Bamiyan,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3394,,
7970.98,7973.3," and the slaughter that followed that,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2919,,
7973.3,7975.540000000001, he went through a new phase,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3556,,
7975.540000000001,7980.540000000001," in which he summoned religious scholars of all sorts,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3462,,
7980.700000000001,7984.340000000001," of famous Cheng Chang from China, who I despise,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3573,,
7984.340000000001,7987.860000000001," but anyway, he came with all of his magic formulas",SPEAKER_00,3,0.368,,
7988.660000000001,7991.780000000001, and then a bunch of various Muslim leaders came.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.335,,
7991.780000000001,7995.34, So Ching's Han was exploring all these different religions,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3204,,
7995.34,7997.26," and not just in a simple way,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3673,,
7997.26,8001.660000000001, he had organized public lectures from these people,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2317,,
8001.660000000001,8005.780000000001," and public debates, not antagonistic debates,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4044,,
8005.780000000001,8007.860000000001, but discussions among groups of people,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4357,,
8007.860000000001,8011.02," who hated each other and would never discuss anything,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5472,,
8011.02,8013.780000000001, and suddenly this powerful man summons them,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6903,,
8013.780000000001,8016.460000000001," and he has to say, okay, well, explain your religion",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3351,,
8016.460000000001,8017.500000000001, and explain yours.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5578,,
8017.5,8020.38, And even sometimes you can't just explain it,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2609,,
8020.38,8022.7, in terms of your own scripture.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3975,,
8022.7,8024.34, What do you say to the people who believe it?,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2837,,
8024.34,8028.26," So he was exploring, but no, he never changed at all.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.379,,
8028.26,8030.34," He was an animist, we would say,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3152,,
8030.34,8033.3, that's not the only term we know to use.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4506,,
8034.42,8036.46," Early in life, he worshiped that mountain",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4109,,
8036.46,8040.42," where he took refuge several times, Burhan Haldun.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2704,,
8040.42,8043.62, Burhan Haldun was the great refuge of his life.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.684,,
8043.62,8046.38," He would go to the top, he would pray,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2613,,
8046.42,8049.3," he would take off his hat, he would take off his belt,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3436,,
8049.3,8052.22, he would stand there before the sky and pray.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2699,,
8052.22,8054.78," Also later on, actually, this became rather dramatic.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4981,,
8054.78,8056.66," He would sometimes go away to pray,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4105,,
8056.66,8058.02, should we invade these people?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3299,,
8058.02,8061.58, And so all of the subjects are waiting to hear,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3287,,
8061.58,8063.34, what's God gonna tell Ching's Han,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3189,,
8063.34,8065.14, when he goes up the mountain.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2567,,
8065.14,8066.78," And so there are episodes like that,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4412,,
8066.78,8068.62, but he was very sincere.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4461,,
8068.62,8070.3," But I think what happened,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3839,,
8070.3,8073.14," the Mongols have so many spirits in the water,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2646,,
8073.14,8075.34," the mountains, everything around them,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4838,,
8075.38,8078.22, and you have to know them personally,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4932,,
8078.22,8081.14, and pray to them and know what they like and don't like.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5718,,
8081.14,8083.22, And should you sing to them,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4345,,
8083.22,8087.22, or should you offer some milk products or what do you do?,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3145,,
8087.22,8088.06, You have to know them.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2724,,
8088.06,8089.82," Well, you get away from Mongolia,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3265,,
8089.82,8091.5," and this was a problem in China,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5426,,
8091.5,8093.42, they didn't know the spirits.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3752,,
8093.42,8096.54, This caused great consternation for the Mongols.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5146,,
8096.54,8098.94," You've got a land here and the spirits don't like us,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4503,,
8098.94,8101.18," they're hostile lands, we don't even know who they are.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3851,,
8101.18,8103.1, We don't know these spirits in China.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4415,,
8103.1,8104.22, It took a long time.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3668,,
8104.3,8106.860000000001," And so gradually Ching's Han,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3215,,
8108.18,8111.820000000001, he kind of moved from just the spirit of the mountain,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4949,,
8111.820000000001,8112.98," that he worshiped,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4251,,
8112.98,8116.66, which remained his main focus of worship his whole life.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3705,,
8116.66,8118.18, He removed that to the sky.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2455,,
8118.18,8120.42, That was the one universal spirit.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5016,,
8120.42,8122.780000000001, It was everywhere in the world.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.669,,
8122.780000000001,8125.18, The sky was the same for every people.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.335,,
8125.18,8127.38," And so for the Mongolians in their language,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3366,,
8128.22,8131.5, the word for sky and the word for heaven,SPEAKER_00,5,0.418,,
8131.5,8134.58, and the word for God and the word for weather,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5084,,
8134.58,8136.14, are all the same.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3503,,
8136.14,8138.18," Tinger, tinger.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2335,,
8138.18,8142.5," And so our Mongolian tinger in the case of the eternal sky,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3945,,
8142.5,8144.42," when they're talking about it in religious terms,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2922,,
8144.42,8145.74, the eternal blue sky.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5354,,
8146.78,8151.7, So he became more universalistic,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4603,,
8151.7,8154.38, in this animist vision of the world.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4863,,
8154.38,8157.62," And so then the sky could embrace all religions,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.246,,
8157.62,8161.1, all religions and all people were trying to attain,SPEAKER_00,5,0.505,,
8161.1,8163.26, the same form of enlightenment.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.262,,
8163.26,8166.1," Well, enlightenment is too specific a word,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3352,,
8166.1,8169.660000000001, but the same form of moral life and guidance from the sky.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.327,,
8169.660000000001,8173.98, He felt that each person knew morality.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2599,,
8173.98,8176.58, Each person could communicate a no morality,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3898,,
8176.58,8177.820000000001, within themselves.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2985,,
8177.820000000001,8179.740000000001, They didn't have to just be taught it,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3857,,
8179.740000000001,8181.54, by somebody from a book.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2675,,
8181.54,8184.740000000001," And in fact, as one of his grandson, Monk Han said,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.285,,
8186.18,8187.900000000001," you people talking to all the others,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3615,,
8187.900000000001,8190.540000000001," to the Christians, the Jews, the Muslims,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3474,,
8190.540000000001,8193.58," the Taoists, said, you people have your scriptures",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2958,,
8193.58,8195.380000000001, and you don't live by them.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3365,,
8195.380000000001,8198.140000000001, We have our spirits and our shamans and our drums,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6598,,
8198.140000000001,8199.380000000001, and we live by them.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6101,,
8200.42,8201.54, And I think it's true.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5,,
8202.42,8204.220000000001," It's just throughout this conversation,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.4129,,
8204.220000000001,8208.7, it's just blowing my mind that the kid from the Mongol step,SPEAKER_01,1,0.2708,,
8208.7,8210.62," that lost everything, right?",SPEAKER_01,1,0.5005,,
8210.62,8215.300000000001," Lost, just had the hardest of lives is now,",SPEAKER_01,1,0.4118,,
8215.98,8220.98," yes, a military genius,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.6874,,
8221.42,8225.38, but also this kind of sage type character,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4208,,
8225.38,8227.66, to understand the value of religious freedom.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.442,,
8227.66,8230.699999999999," I mean, there is a cynical way to see all these things",SPEAKER_01,2,0.2415,,
8230.699999999999,8233.34, because he did awfully a lot of things,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3703,,
8233.34,8235.099999999999, that look like he's a feminist.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.3554,,
8236.34,8240.14," And you're saying, well, the cynical way to see that",SPEAKER_01,5,0.3767,,
8240.14,8242.539999999999, is what he saw the value of promoting women,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4214,,
8242.539999999999,8244.099999999999, in positions of power,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4697,,
8244.1,8246.86, because they create a more stable society,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3252,,
8246.86,8249.42," and there's less power struggles, all that.",SPEAKER_01,2,0.3723,,
8249.42,8252.34, But the reality is there's a lot of things,SPEAKER_01,3,0.5097,,
8252.34,8253.98, that look awfully progressive,SPEAKER_01,2,0.3698,,
8253.98,8256.54, about the things he's implemented and they stayed.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.4354,,
8256.54,8258.82, I'm not trying to say it in modern terms.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3625,,
8259.78,8262.62," When you have 1 million people, you've got to use every one.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.403,,
8262.62,8264.94, And the men are fighting and so he left women,SPEAKER_00,2,0.241,,
8264.94,8267.54," to administer a lot of things inside the country,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4681,,
8267.54,8269.26," the economy in particular,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3548,,
8269.26,8272.7, and then in some of the ancillary Turkic kingdoms,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2902,,
8272.7,8275.060000000001," around the Mongols, such as the Angut,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2733,,
8275.060000000001,8278.300000000001, the Tarlik and different Mongol and the Uyghur,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2557,,
8278.300000000001,8282.460000000001, even were administered by his daughters primarily.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2686,,
8282.460000000001,8285.220000000001, And then his wives were in charge of administering,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3802,,
8285.220000000001,8289.1, the land of Mongolia itself and handling the economy.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5029,,
8289.1,8293.220000000001," So he was using the women, but in a very practical way,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4973,,
8294.1,8297.66, but it wasn't necessarily in our ideological way.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4799,,
8297.66,8299.980000000001, I think it's the same with the environment.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5178,,
8299.980000000001,8302.140000000001, I'm not trying to say he was environmentalist,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3113,,
8302.14,8305.619999999999," in our modern way, but he passed very strict laws",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4107,,
8305.619999999999,8310.22," about the use of water and also about not using water,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2851,,
8310.22,8314.06, that you couldn't move water into an area to irrigate it.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2708,,
8314.06,8317.26, That was violating the earth and violating the water.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4244,,
8317.26,8319.18," So they think, a lot of the historians,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4784,,
8319.18,8320.58," they think the Mongols are so stupid,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.6807,,
8320.58,8322.9, they let the irrigation system be destroyed.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4216,,
8322.9,8325.859999999999," No, it takes more work to destroy an irrigation system",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3985,,
8325.859999999999,8327.34, than it does to create it.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3512,,
8327.34,8329.9, They destroyed those systems out of a policy.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5775,,
8329.98,8333.18," And that was, this is gonna return to pasture land.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5199,,
8334.42,8336.3, Just last year Kublai Khan was the one,SPEAKER_00,5,0.332,,
8336.3,8339.1," who changed that actually, and then started allowing",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3818,,
8339.1,8342.18, for more irrigation and the movement of water and things.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4335,,
8342.18,8346.22," But Chinggis Khan, we can't use these modern terms",SPEAKER_00,2,0.32,,
8346.22,8349.22," of like a human rights crusader,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3229,,
8349.22,8351.82, or I'm trying to say he's a Democrat in the modern sense,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2971,,
8351.82,8354.06," or environmentalist or a feminist,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3572,,
8354.06,8356.34, but all of this was a part of it.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3519,,
8356.34,8359.46, Another part was the protection of envoys.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3718,,
8359.500000000002,8363.02," He said every envoy, every ambassador, every messenger",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7132,,
8364.02,8367.380000000001," is protected from arrest, from torture, and from killing.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5182,,
8367.380000000001,8372.380000000001," And if you kill one of ours, we will wipe you out.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3769,,
8375.7,8378.900000000001," And in 1240, that was the destruction of Kiev.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2614,,
8378.900000000001,8380.820000000002, This is after Chinggis Khan already.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4705,,
8380.820000000002,8384.980000000001," There's Aguday Khan, his son, the happy, happy drunk.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4147,,
8384.980000000001,8388.26," Aguday Khan's army had come there under Subodai,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2902,,
8389.02,8390.74," the greatest general in the history of the world,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.9226,,
8390.74,8393.02," I would say, Subodai, a person who's not Subodai.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3061,,
8393.02,8395.5, Was it Chinggis Khan for the military part?,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3339,,
8395.5,8396.98, He was the greatest strategist,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7605,,
8396.98,8399.34, for organizing everything together.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4981,,
8399.34,8401.380000000001, But the military part was Subodai.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4259,,
8401.380000000001,8404.42," So Subodai had been there, and they sent in an ambassador",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3531,,
8404.42,8406.26, who happened to be a woman.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2891,,
8406.26,8410.14, Now some of the Western sources say a daughter of Chinggis Khan.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3098,,
8410.14,8413.34," I have no evidence of that, and I don't quite believe it,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4915,,
8413.34,8415.7, but maybe she was kin to him or something.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4457,,
8415.7,8417.66, Some say she was a daughter of Chinggis Khan.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4286,,
8417.7,8419.06, Others say she was a witch.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.309,,
8420.02,8423.02, The people of Kiev decided she was a witch and killed her.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4761,,
8423.98,8427.22," Okay, that's it, that's it.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.7998,,
8428.22,8432.06, Kiev was destroyed for killing a Mongol envoy.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4573,,
8432.06,8437.14, The envoy is a method of communication and diplomacy.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.4318,,
8437.14,8439.78, And so if you destroy that method of communication,SPEAKER_01,1,0.2728,,
8439.78,8442.18, or disrespect it in any way.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.4915,,
8442.18,8443.18, Exactly.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6801,,
8443.18,8445.46, And that sends a signal to everybody else.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.3816,,
8445.460000000001,8448.500000000002," You send an envoy, you respect it.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5307,,
8448.500000000002,8450.34," That's why these plans,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3116,,
8450.34,8452.460000000001," I say that the making of the modern world,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3415,,
8452.460000000001,8453.900000000001," most of the ideas have,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3839,,
8453.900000000001,8456.86, we accept the idea we don't do the practice.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4709,,
8456.86,8459.380000000001, All of us accept today diplomatic freedom.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6014,,
8459.380000000001,8462.02, Diplomats are killed around the world yearly.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2757,,
8462.02,8464.62, We accept the idea of female equality,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2941,,
8464.62,8466.42, and emancipation of every way.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7006,,
8466.42,8467.820000000002," But in fact, they're enslaved",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2685,,
8467.820000000002,8469.900000000001, in many parts of the world today.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5978,,
8470.820000000002,8473.7, We accept the idea of religious freedom.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3374,,
8473.7,8475.26," Oh, but not those people.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3507,,
8476.22,8478.98," Theirs isn't good, their religion isn't right.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4869,,
8478.98,8481.5," But our religion, we will tolerate them,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3355,,
8481.5,8484.14," but they gotta be more like, no.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.475,,
8484.14,8485.66," We only say these things,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2987,,
8485.66,8487.82, but the world still hasn't achieved something.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4304,,
8487.82,8492.66, And he did achieve these within his empire in his time.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4368,,
8492.66,8493.94, He achieved those.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4858,,
8493.94,8496.1," So one of the things we've mentioned,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.463,,
8496.1,8499.06," but I think is really, really fascinating",SPEAKER_01,4,0.4772,,
8499.06,8502.14, and maybe in a measurable impact,SPEAKER_01,2,0.3278,,
8502.14,8504.9, that Genghis Khan had is on trade.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3189,,
8505.94,8507.78," And you could say a lot of stuff,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.35,,
8507.78,8511.22, but basically establishing a unified trade network,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3894,,
8511.22,8515.06, that spanned I don't know how many thousands of kilometers.,SPEAKER_01,2,0.3705,,
8516.34,8518.66, And there's a lot of interesting things,SPEAKER_01,4,0.4789,,
8518.66,8520.94, that were done to enable that trade.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.2919,,
8520.94,8525.42, One is providing safety and security,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3743,,
8525.42,8528.22," of not just the envoys, like we mentioned,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.4061,,
8528.22,8531.14," for communication in the military context,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.4712,,
8531.14,8533.300000000001, but for the merchants.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4967,,
8533.3,8536.3, Can you speak to what Genghis Khan did,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3415,,
8536.3,8538.14, for the trade network connected,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3958,,
8538.14,8540.14, to the Silk Road as an example?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2874,,
8540.14,8542.98, Nomads in general are interested in trade.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3975,,
8542.98,8544.099999999999," And throughout most of history,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6514,,
8544.099999999999,8546.82, they have been the traders who carried the goods,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2559,,
8546.82,8549.859999999999, from one city to another or one oasis to another.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5914,,
8549.859999999999,8553.259999999998, And so the Mongols were also extremely interested,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3522,,
8553.259999999998,8554.859999999999, and extremely dependent.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.514,,
8554.859999999999,8557.06, They could create very little in their home country.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4093,,
8557.06,8559.019999999999, They couldn't grow hardly anything,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4249,,
8559.019999999999,8561.06, and they didn't have the technological skills,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4741,,
8561.06,8562.9, for most of the crafts.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3914,,
8562.9,8564.82, So they're very dependent on trade.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4934,,
8565.94,8570.18," Well, they raised the status of merchants very high.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5305,,
8570.18,8572.94, This was particularly a problem in the Chinese world.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5409,,
8572.94,8576.22," It wasn't so much in the Christian or the Muslim world,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4078,,
8576.22,8578.1," but certainly in the Chinese world,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4233,,
8578.1,8580.779999999999, where merchants were considered extremely low.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4153,,
8580.779999999999,8583.74, And all of a sudden he raises them up above scholars.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2898,,
8583.74,8585.779999999999, They're going to have certain rights.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3983,,
8585.779999999999,8589.5," For example, they get to be taxed one time.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2935,,
8589.5,8591.699999999999," Whatever the national taxes, that's it.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3372,,
8591.740000000002,8595.26, They're not taxed every time they stop in some new town.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4035,,
8595.26,8600.26, And he created a set of what we would call rest houses,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4501,,
8600.740000000002,8605.740000000002," or recuperation centers where they could get fresh horses,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3246,,
8606.7,8610.42," they could get food, they could deposit their money",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2899,,
8610.42,8612.42, and get paper receipts that could be used,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2942,,
8612.42,8614.78, anywhere in the empire.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4886,,
8614.78,8616.18, They were guaranteed protection.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3438,,
8616.18,8617.62, If they had to pass through an area,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3242,,
8617.62,8621.060000000001," where it might be dangerous, then a small group,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3868,,
8621.06,8624.9, a squad of men and horses would go with them.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3357,,
8624.9,8627.14, So trade was extremely important.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3609,,
8627.14,8630.38," And then the Mongols, they also,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2468,,
8630.38,8633.019999999999, they supported trade in a very odd way.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.538,,
8633.019999999999,8634.66, And that is the merchants would come in,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2437,,
8634.66,8638.5," and they would ask for an outrageous price for some goods,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3589,,
8638.5,8640.42," you know, much more than they should get,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4358,,
8640.42,8642.66, waiting for the Mongols to bargain them down.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2561,,
8644.18,8645.5," And the Mongols would say,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2448,,
8646.619999999999,8648.939999999999, I'll give you much more than that.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5678,,
8649.9,8652.060000000001," And as his grandson or his son,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4409,,
8652.060000000001,8654.380000000001," Ogede Khan was once asked, why do you do that?",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2145,,
8654.380000000001,8655.220000000001, You've got to stop doing that.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.245,,
8655.220000000001,8659.300000000001," This was a Muslim financial advisor, he'd called him.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3893,,
8659.300000000001,8660.62," He told him, well, you've got to stop paying",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4074,,
8660.62,8662.140000000001, more than people ask.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5313,,
8662.140000000001,8666.060000000001," And Ogede said, where's the money gonna go?",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4968,,
8666.060000000001,8667.34, It's still in my empire.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6055,,
8667.34,8669.94," It's gonna come back eventually, you know?",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3906,,
8669.94,8672.140000000001, And so they had a much different attitude,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4121,,
8672.140000000001,8673.140000000001, with great respect.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.724,,
8673.140000000001,8677.26, And I think a symbol of that is in the time of Kubla Khan,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3816,,
8677.300000000001,8679.94, when we see that his uncle and father went to China,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2608,,
8679.94,8681.460000000001, and came back from China.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4999,,
8681.460000000001,8683.1," And then on the second trip,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2299,,
8683.1,8685.74, Marco Polo went with him to China and back.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2863,,
8685.74,8687.380000000001, They were safe the whole way.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4635,,
8687.380000000001,8688.460000000001, Their goods were safe.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4215,,
8688.460000000001,8691.02, They came back with tremendous amount of wealth.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6942,,
8691.02,8692.26, They were never harassed.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4452,,
8692.26,8693.86," And the mere fact that they could cross,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.267,,
8693.86,8695.1," it took two years,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4065,,
8695.1,8698.66, but the mere fact that they could cross the whole continent,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3495,,
8698.66,8701.62," safely and come back,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5886,,
8701.62,8703.18, that was unprecedented.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3842,,
8703.18,8705.460000000001, We really don't have any well-documented case,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4184,,
8705.86,8707.980000000001, of anybody safe from China visiting Europe,SPEAKER_00,5,0.474,,
8707.980000000001,8710.94, or Europe visiting China before the Mongols.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2993,,
8710.94,8712.34," But since Genghis Khan,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3183,,
8712.34,8714.980000000001, there's never been a year without contact,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3066,,
8714.980000000001,8716.380000000001, between East and West.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3426,,
8716.380000000001,8717.42, It was permanent.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3568,,
8717.42,8719.900000000001," Once he created it, it was permanent.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2978,,
8719.900000000001,8721.460000000001, I don't think it's possible to measure,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4417,,
8721.460000000001,8723.140000000001, the positive impact of that,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3521,,
8723.140000000001,8725.820000000002, because it wasn't just trade of goods.,SPEAKER_01,2,0.3391,,
8725.820000000002,8728.460000000001," It was also exchange,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.2488,,
8728.460000000001,8731.980000000001," explicit or implicit along the way, exchange of ideas,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.4034,,
8731.980000000001,8734.500000000002," whether that's exchange of technologies,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3219,,
8734.54,8737.62," exchange of like philosophical ideas,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.2936,,
8737.62,8739.3," scientific ideas,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.3373,,
8740.7,8742.34," technical, mathematical ideas,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.3961,,
8742.34,8747.06, all of this spread throughout and constantly circulating.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6467,,
8748.94,8751.42, Can you speak to that aspect of it?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2875,,
8751.42,8755.22," Yes, it was exchange of ideas on every level,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4711,,
8755.22,8760.02," ideas, technology, ideologies, beliefs,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4496,,
8760.02,8761.42," scientific information,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3652,,
8761.42,8762.86, everything was being exchanged,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2677,,
8763.26,8767.140000000001, even agricultural goods of new crops for new areas.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6042,,
8767.140000000001,8771.54," But Genghis Khan, he had a part of his genius",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3243,,
8771.54,8774.74, of organization was knowing what skill people had,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2829,,
8774.74,8776.900000000001, that would contribute towards his empire.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3505,,
8776.900000000001,8780.5," For example, the Muslims were very good with arithmetic.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3189,,
8780.5,8784.26," In fact, he conquered the little empire of Khoresm",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2525,,
8784.26,8787.060000000001, from which we get the word algorithm,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2823,,
8787.060000000001,8788.86, because there was a mathematician there,SPEAKER_00,3,0.243,,
8788.86,8790.66, who invented algorithms.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.555,,
8790.66,8793.619999999999," And so Khoresm, he conquered it very quickly,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4489,,
8793.619999999999,8796.58," very easily, no problem, but it belonged to him.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.436,,
8796.58,8800.34, But the Muslims were using the zero.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3314,,
8800.34,8802.98, The Mongols were absolutely impressed with that.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5122,,
8802.98,8804.02," The Chinese less so,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3996,,
8804.02,8805.9, they're very suspicious about the zero.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4009,,
8805.9,8807.78, But the Mongols were very impressed,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3235,,
8807.78,8811.9, because herders' numbers are important to them,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3622,,
8811.9,8813.66, for keeping up with their animals.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.5052,,
8814.74,8816.82," In fact, the Mongols have a simple system.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3106,,
8816.82,8819.22, They reduce all animals to the number of horses.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2705,,
8819.22,8821.74, You can ask somebody how many animals you can have,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2994,,
8821.74,8824.58," and they can say, well, 100 horses.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4919,,
8824.58,8826.9, And it doesn't mean they have 100 horses.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3464,,
8826.9,8831.9," It's gonna be like five cows count as four horses,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3151,,
8834.019999999999,8836.619999999999," five sheep or five goats count as one horse,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5516,,
8838.46,8841.22, four camels count as five horses.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3824,,
8841.22,8843.179999999998, So they reduced it all down like that.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4688,,
8843.179999999998,8845.42, The Mongols take a census of everything.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3901,,
8845.42,8847.42, And that's one of the first things Genghis Khan did.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.436,,
8847.460000000001,8849.06, And that was one of the demands he made,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4112,,
8849.06,8850.74," of every place he went,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7042,,
8850.74,8853.62, is a complete census of your people.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6917,,
8853.62,8855.7," And every house had to post outside,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3687,,
8855.7,8857.66," how many people, how many animals,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2518,,
8857.66,8861.02," what did they do, the occupations, all this information.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5611,,
8861.02,8864.82, So they needed good mathematics for this.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5147,,
8864.82,8866.34, The Muslims provided it.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4363,,
8866.34,8868.22," So they took the Muslims to China,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3424,,
8868.22,8870.5, these Middle Eastern scholars and all.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4706,,
8870.5,8873.5," Unfortunately, they were rather ruthless sometimes",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4495,,
8873.5,8876.38," when it came to implementing the tax policies,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2775,,
8876.380000000001,8879.740000000002, but they became the financial advisors to him.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4191,,
8881.54,8884.420000000002, Other groups of people had other roles like that,SPEAKER_00,3,0.371,,
8884.420000000002,8887.54, and he was moving them around constantly.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4032,,
8887.54,8890.220000000001, And so you had a combination.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2827,,
8890.220000000001,8892.62," As I said, he himself had that genius",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4687,,
8892.62,8896.140000000001," for combining new bits of technology,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4606,,
8896.140000000001,8899.300000000001, but it created a new kind of cultural spirit,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4125,,
8899.300000000001,8902.500000000002, in which other people were also combining technology,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2786,,
8902.500000000002,8905.220000000001, at other levels and being encouraged.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.437,,
8905.22,8908.019999999999, It was no longer heresy or the devil's work,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4566,,
8908.019999999999,8909.42, to bring in this thing.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.554,,
8909.42,8912.06," So we had the spread of printing, for example.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4973,,
8912.06,8913.82, We had the partial spread of something,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3703,,
8913.82,8917.539999999999," that's just print money, for example.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3265,,
8917.539999999999,8920.779999999999, We had almanacs being created now through printing,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3214,,
8920.779999999999,8924.22, that combined different calendars and different information,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3273,,
8924.22,8925.539999999999, that was coming along.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3383,,
8925.539999999999,8929.74, But one simple but lethal form of technology,SPEAKER_00,3,0.318,,
8929.74,8932.06," was that, for example, Chinese had gunpowder.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.321,,
8932.939999999999,8937.34," Mostly it was used for fireworks, religious things.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5077,,
8937.34,8939.1, And then sometimes in warfare it was used,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3691,,
8939.1,8941.019999999999, for a kind of primitive hand grenade,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3195,,
8941.019999999999,8943.98, or a primitive bomb that could be thrown with a trebuchet.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2922,,
8943.98,8947.58," And this is in the time of Kubla Khan more, the grandson.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.497,,
8947.58,8948.82, So they had that.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5265,,
8948.82,8951.98," The Middle Eastern, the Muslims and the Byzantines,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3273,,
8951.98,8956.98," especially, they had naphtha, what we call Greek fire,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2495,,
8957.859999999999,8960.66, flamethrowers that could set things on fire.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3917,,
8961.619999999999,8965.5, The Europeans did not excel very much in technology.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4776,,
8965.5,8967.34," They were behind in almost everything,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2922,,
8967.34,8970.78, but they could cast bells for churches.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.498,,
8971.7,8973.619999999999," Okay, let's take that bell",SPEAKER_00,3,0.7793,,
8973.619999999999,8975.619999999999, and we're gonna turn it on its side.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.342,,
8977.06,8981.3, We're gonna use some principles of the flamethrower,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3568,,
8981.3,8984.66, and we're gonna use the gunpowder from China,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2889,,
8984.66,8985.82, and you've got a cannon.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4441,,
8986.78,8988.619999999999," So the Mongols, even early on,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3136,,
8988.660000000002,8990.78," by the time they got to the siege of Baghdad,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3163,,
8990.78,8993.34," but not, I think, in the lifetime of Chinggis Khan,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4707,,
8993.34,8996.900000000001," but soon thereafter in his sons and grandsons,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3945,,
8996.900000000001,9000.34, they were using some very primitive forms of cannon,SPEAKER_00,3,0.359,,
9001.220000000001,9004.58, and even something like firing rods.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2742,,
9004.58,9006.26," We can't even call it anything like a rifle,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5076,,
9006.26,9010.78, but it could fire a very small ballistic device at all.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4431,,
9010.78,9015.5," So this combination of metal ergy, gunpowder,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2637,,
9015.5,9018.02," flamethrowers, you put it all together",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6065,,
9018.02,9021.9, and you come up with something incredibly different.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4694,,
9021.9,9023.74," So if we jump around a little bit,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.6423,,
9023.74,9026.14," sort of on the topic of a cannon,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.4467,,
9026.14,9030.26, what are some technological developments,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3057,,
9030.26,9035.26, that Chinggis Khan and his son and Kublai Khan were using?,SPEAKER_01,2,0.2551,,
9036.06,9038.42, So how much gunpowder were they using?,SPEAKER_01,2,0.3427,,
9038.42,9039.9," In general, what was their approach",SPEAKER_01,3,0.476,,
9039.9,9042.62," to the siege warfare, for example?",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3667,,
9042.62,9044.78, What are some different ideas there?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3697,,
9044.78,9047.02," If we switch to the grandson Kublai Khan,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2718,,
9048.58,9052.78," he, first of all, he changed a lot of the strategies.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3259,,
9052.78,9053.86, They were no longer working.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4776,,
9053.86,9056.82," The Mongol system worked perfectly on the grassland,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6723,,
9056.82,9058.26," but by the time you get to Hungary,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3966,,
9058.26,9060.02, the grassland starts to give out.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4766,,
9060.02,9062.58," By the time you get to Poland, it's so many farms,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3434,,
9062.58,9064.5, it's hard for horses to get through the farms,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4675,,
9064.5,9066.26, and they don't wanna go on the roads.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2461,,
9066.26,9069.06," By the time you get to the Indus River,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3108,,
9069.06,9072.54," it's too hot, too humid, the bows are beginning to wilt,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.5789,,
9072.54,9075.5," the horses are exhausted, it's not working.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5383,,
9075.5,9077.18," So to conquer South China,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.302,,
9077.18,9079.7, Kublai Khan had to come up with new things.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3143,,
9080.94,9085.26," One thing, the South Chinese had built a Great Wall.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2385,,
9085.26,9087.42, It was called the Great Wall of the Sea.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4198,,
9087.42,9089.98," This is before the wall that we know as the Great Wall,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7051,,
9089.98,9093.26, which is really the Ming Wall of the Ming Dynasty was built.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3556,,
9093.26,9095.18," But the Great Wall of the Sea,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3101,,
9095.18,9097.54, and they used it as a defensive navy.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4598,,
9097.54,9100.3," They had the largest navy in the world, it was defensive.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2791,,
9100.3,9102.62, And it was most literally defensive,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4853,,
9102.62,9105.14, and that came time for warfare.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.352,,
9105.14,9106.9, They would chain the ships together,SPEAKER_00,4,0.281,,
9106.9,9109.86, across the mouth of a harbor to protect the city.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4225,,
9109.86,9112.34, And so it became a wall.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2739,,
9112.34,9116.22," So actually, if we rewind, Kublai Khan, who was he?",SPEAKER_01,2,0.316,,
9116.22,9120.18, And what was the state of China at that time,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4716,,
9120.18,9125.18, that kind of sets up this idea of ships and siege warfare?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3848,,
9125.82,9128.34," In 1215, Chinggis Khan conquered the city",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2375,,
9128.34,9130.02, we now know as Beijing.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4308,,
9130.02,9133.74, It was the capital of the Jin Dynasty of Northern China.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3127,,
9133.74,9137.58," At that time, Southern China was ruled by the Song Dynasty,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3011,,
9137.58,9139.34, or usually called the Southern Song.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3731,,
9139.34,9142.18, He had already conquered the Shixia Kingdom,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2567,,
9142.18,9143.78, or the Tangut people.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2811,,
9143.78,9147.82, And so most of Northern China was under the control,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3095,,
9147.82,9150.34, of the Mongols from about 1215.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3465,,
9150.34,9152.26, And then he conquered middle.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2894,,
9152.26,9155.26," Later, his descendants conquered middle",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2806,,
9155.26,9158.42, and then Kublai Khan was the one to take on the South.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2262,,
9158.42,9160.98," But Kublai Khan was born that year in 1215,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3311,,
9161.02,9164.98, about three months after the capture of Beijing.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3074,,
9164.98,9166.42, And he was nobody.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.7362,,
9167.3,9171.7, He was the second son of the fourth son of Chinggis Khan.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2917,,
9171.7,9174.38," Well, he's got lots of cousins out there",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3298,,
9174.38,9175.62, who've been riding around.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4062,,
9175.62,9176.86, They're conquering Russia,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3869,,
9176.86,9179.38, and they've already burned down Kiev,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2567,,
9179.38,9181.9, and they've conquered different places in the world.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6181,,
9181.9,9183.3, They're real Mongols.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3299,,
9183.3,9184.9, That's their whole life.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2648,,
9184.9,9187.22, And he's born and he doesn't meet...,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4447,,
9187.22,9189.26, Chinggis Khan is about seven years old,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2936,,
9189.34,9192.9, and Chinggis Khan was away on conquest in Central Asia.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2843,,
9192.9,9196.54," And Chinggis Khan came back and he met him and he said,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4178,,
9196.54,9199.7," oh, he doesn't look like a Mongol.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4331,,
9199.7,9201.14, He looks like his mother's people.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3424,,
9201.14,9203.02," His mother was a Sorakhtani,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2989,,
9203.02,9205.02, who was actually a part of the royal family,SPEAKER_00,1,0.285,,
9205.02,9206.46," of the Merkit people,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.255,,
9206.46,9208.82, whom he had conquered sometime earlier.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2488,,
9208.82,9211.26, And so it looks like his mother's people,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3123,,
9211.26,9212.58, who was a little bit more tawny.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4148,,
9212.58,9214.1, Mongols tend to be very white,SPEAKER_00,3,0.375,,
9214.1,9217.54, with very bright red cheeks,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3012,,
9217.580000000002,9220.46, and have a certain very round face and so on.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4016,,
9220.46,9223.5, And so he looked different.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4277,,
9223.5,9225.1," And for whatever reason,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2737,,
9225.1,9227.94," his mother, I think she recognized the difference",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3825,,
9227.94,9229.22, and treated him differently.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4733,,
9229.22,9231.740000000002," Her oldest son was called Mung,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2601,,
9231.740000000002,9233.820000000002," a later Mung Khan, Mung.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3402,,
9233.820000000002,9235.3," And she wanted him to become,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3822,,
9235.3,9239.38," even though her husband was drunk,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2661,,
9239.38,9242.660000000002, who died out on campaign drunk.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5075,,
9242.660000000002,9246.18, And she took over Northern China,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2872,,
9246.18,9247.7, and she began to put it together,SPEAKER_00,5,0.371,,
9247.7,9250.46," and she wanted her son to become the great Han,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3717,,
9250.46,9253.62, the emperor of the Mongol Empire.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4802,,
9253.62,9254.78, And this wasn't in line.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4474,,
9254.78,9255.9, This wasn't gonna happen,SPEAKER_00,1,0.635,,
9255.9,9258.74, because he's the fourth son out of three others,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3111,,
9258.74,9261.46," way in line, way ahead of her.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4191,,
9261.46,9263.14, But she caused the revolution.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.315,,
9263.14,9264.26, She made it happen.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3805,,
9264.26,9267.06, She put her son in Mung Khan in 1251.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2824,,
9267.06,9268.58, He became great Han.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5523,,
9269.82,9271.54, He only lived till 1259.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3152,,
9271.54,9272.94, He died of something.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4711,,
9272.94,9274.66, It could have been cholera,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3397,,
9274.66,9276.22, or they're different stories,SPEAKER_00,3,0.393,,
9276.22,9277.9, and I don't know the truth of it.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3455,,
9277.9,9280.02," But he died on campaign in China,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3181,,
9280.02,9282.38, trying to conquer Southern China.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3377,,
9282.38,9284.06," Well, up to this point,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4215,,
9284.06,9287.18, Kubla Khan had not been distinguishing himself.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3987,,
9287.18,9290.3," His mother was, she was a Christian woman,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2588,,
9290.3,9293.14, but she had a Buddhist nurse for him.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4318,,
9293.14,9296.38, And she had Chinese scholars come in to tutor him.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2442,,
9296.38,9298.94, She had a very good education for him.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4525,,
9299.86,9301.34, And I think that she planned,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3133,,
9301.34,9303.22, that he was gonna be a great administrator,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2586,,
9303.22,9304.9, under his older brother,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2929,,
9304.9,9307.1, and he was gonna administer the lands in China.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3656,,
9307.1,9309.54, And so he was learning all this stuff for it.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4531,,
9309.54,9310.86," But the older brother,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.437,,
9310.86,9313.26, he insisted on sending him out on campaign.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4715,,
9313.26,9314.9," Oh, but he was overweight.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4406,,
9314.9,9315.74, He was fat.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4444,,
9315.74,9316.86, He had gout.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4109,,
9316.86,9318.1, He needed to go rest.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3755,,
9318.1,9319.98, There was always some excuse.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3634,,
9319.98,9321.74," And the brother was assigning people,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2188,,
9321.74,9325.26," Orihang Dai, who was the son of Subodai, the great general.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3115,,
9325.26,9327.42, He assigned him to teach him warfare.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4429,,
9328.7,9330.7, He wasn't great on the battlefield.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4892,,
9330.7,9331.58, He really was not.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.53,,
9331.58,9334.22, But he was very smart.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3946,,
9335.22,9336.62," And at first a little bit lazy,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5208,,
9336.62,9338.06," like talking about the religion,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3505,,
9338.06,9340.1," sitting around, go hunting,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4085,,
9340.1,9342.94, as long as he had many with him to do the shooting,SPEAKER_00,4,0.335,,
9342.94,9345.66, and then to prepare the food and all.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4997,,
9346.82,9350.54, And his territory in Northern China,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2857,,
9350.54,9354.62, was just being run in the dirt by these administrators,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4278,,
9354.62,9356.22, the Mongols had brought in.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2636,,
9356.22,9357.86," They were just overtaxing the people,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.45,,
9357.86,9360.18," cheating the people, doing everything wrong.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.6791,,
9360.18,9362.82, And his mother basically just pulled his chain,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3399,,
9362.82,9364.98," and she said, go to your land.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3142,,
9364.98,9365.82, This is your land.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7561,,
9365.82,9367.38, You have to administer this land.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3655,,
9367.38,9368.22, You go there.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4907,,
9368.22,9369.06, You live there.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6122,,
9369.06,9370.98, You take charge.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4301,,
9370.98,9373.7, And everybody was terrified of the mother.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5891,,
9373.7,9376.02, And so he ran off to China,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3914,,
9376.02,9377.58, and he started administering his land,SPEAKER_00,5,0.53,,
9377.58,9379.3, and he started learning how to do it.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4915,,
9379.3,9381.74," Well, when his brother died in 1259,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3441,,
9381.74,9384.34, he was down on the Yangtze River,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3418,,
9385.3,9387.54, on a campaign that he was sent by his brother.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3659,,
9387.54,9389.7, He was having no success at all.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6735,,
9389.7,9391.3," But he thought, okay, the brother's dead.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5947,,
9391.3,9393.42, I should finish the campaign.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3143,,
9393.42,9396.02," Meanwhile, his youngest brother, Arihbukh,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3575,,
9396.02,9398.26, Arihbukh was another hot-headed Mongol,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3392,,
9398.26,9399.9," like their father, Tulu.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5086,,
9399.9,9403.54, He was rather hot-headed and he was back in Mongolia,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4062,,
9403.54,9405.740000000002," and his tolerance for religions,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.482,,
9405.740000000002,9408.1, he had to oversee the debate one time,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3221,,
9408.1,9409.5, between the Taoists and the Buddhists,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2445,,
9409.5,9411.7, because the Mongols thought the Taoists,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2476,,
9411.7,9413.94," were overtaxing everybody, the Buddhists.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.6505,,
9413.94,9415.78, And so he had to oversee it.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4808,,
9415.78,9418.1, He got mad and he picked up a statue of the Buddha,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5456,,
9418.1,9420.86, and beat the Taoist representative to death.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.353,,
9420.86,9424.7, So he just wasn't good for moderating debates.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4839,,
9425.94,9429.78, So he was going to be the new Great Khan.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3217,,
9429.78,9432.58, So he was declared the Great Khan in Mongolia,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5422,,
9434.06,9436.42, but this was the turning light for Kubla Khan,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3367,,
9436.42,9438.5, who had never achieved much of anything,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4011,,
9438.5,9440.46, other than talking to people.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3461,,
9440.46,9445.3," So his wife, Chaby, sent him some coded messages,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5333,,
9445.3,9449.54," basically telling him, forget about Southern China.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3068,,
9449.54,9450.78, It's gonna always be there.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3203,,
9450.78,9452.54, You can conquer that some other time.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3889,,
9452.54,9455.86," Right now, your brother is taking over the empire.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5668,,
9455.86,9457.94, You should be the new emperor.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5142,,
9457.94,9461.580000000002, You are the next son after Meng Khan.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5184,,
9463.06,9466.340000000002, And somehow she invigorated him and he came back,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4508,,
9466.340000000002,9468.660000000002," and even though he didn't have all the military strategy,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.302,,
9468.660000000002,9471.98," he had Northern China, the resources were immense.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2701,,
9471.98,9473.340000000002, He could cut off Mongolia.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3352,,
9473.34,9478.06, Mongolia was very dependent on Northern China for food.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4107,,
9478.06,9480.3, All the Mongols supported Arik Bok.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3838,,
9480.3,9482.26," All the ones in Central Asia,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4882,,
9482.26,9484.46, all of them were supporting Arik Bok.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2456,,
9484.46,9487.62, And so he went to get food from them,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3051,,
9489.02,9491.14, and then they didn't wanna give up their food.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3856,,
9491.14,9493.34," Yeah, we wanna support you for Great Khan",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6124,,
9493.34,9495.46, but we're not giving up our food.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5031,,
9495.46,9500.42, So he was basically kind of starved into submission in 1262,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3876,,
9500.42,9503.1, and then he was taken prisoner into China,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4676,,
9503.1,9508.1, and then he mysteriously passed away in 1264,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3356,,
9510.22,9514.54, while a legal case was being brought against him for trial,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3151,,
9514.54,9517.02, but he never made it to trial.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3369,,
9517.02,9518.3, He was gone.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4159,,
9518.3,9523.3, So Kubla Khan not really distinguished himself very much,SPEAKER_00,2,0.5089,,
9523.94,9527.82, but he didn't have the genius of his grandfather.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5021,,
9527.82,9530.42, I won't say that but he was smart and clever.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.481,,
9530.42,9534.42, He understood more about China than most Mongols did,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2927,,
9534.42,9537.82, and he understood more about Mongols than most Chinese did.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4803,,
9539.34,9541.3, So the great thing left the Chinggis Khan,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6731,,
9541.3,9546.3," said on his deathbed, finish conquering China.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3317,,
9546.46,9548.22, That was the great objective.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3304,,
9548.22,9552.58, So Kublai was going to fulfill this,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3551,,
9552.58,9555.62, and they didn't know how the great wall of ships,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3067,,
9555.62,9557.82, was protecting the Southern Song.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3917,,
9557.82,9560.22, This huge Yangtze River was so bad,SPEAKER_00,1,0.7441,,
9560.98,9563.34," the ocean on the side, all of these things",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3738,,
9563.34,9564.98, were protecting them.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3187,,
9565.86,9570.22, So he had one of his very smart generals named Aju,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4512,,
9570.22,9571.78, who was a real Mongol,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3333,,
9571.78,9573.94, but he was also able to think in innovative way.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4805,,
9573.94,9575.54, He was the grandson of Subadai,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2449,,
9576.58,9580.02, and he went with his father Urihanggadai,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3667,,
9580.02,9583.86, on the conquest of the Red River of Northern Vietnam,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3897,,
9583.86,9585.34, against the Dai Viet people.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3293,,
9587.14,9588.86, They went down the river.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3363,,
9588.86,9592.42, They were trying to surround the Chinese territory.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3191,,
9592.42,9593.86," They were gonna hit them from the north,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3418,,
9593.86,9595.42, from the west and from the south.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3381,,
9595.42,9599.38, So they went down the Red River to conquer the Dai Viet.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3446,,
9599.38,9602.9, The Dai Viet moved their army up on the other side by boat,SPEAKER_00,3,0.281,,
9602.9,9605.58, and then they had a whole core of elephants.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3152,,
9605.58,9606.74," So they had the Mongols on one side,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4546,,
9606.74,9610.78, the river and the Dai Viet forces on the other side.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.274,,
9610.78,9615.02," Urihanggadai was a smart man, not a genius but smart",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4946,,
9615.02,9617.42, and he already knew from campaigns in Burma,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3909,,
9617.42,9619.78, that the only way to route the elephants,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2113,,
9619.78,9622.54, was with flaming arrows to the feet.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4983,,
9622.54,9623.7, That was it.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.325,,
9623.7,9626.98, But he recognized that they came up on boats.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.37,,
9626.98,9628.9, Mongols didn't like boats.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.433,,
9628.9,9631.62," It just, they crossed the river on a goat skin.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3168,,
9631.62,9633.1, They wanted to do something organic.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3828,,
9633.1,9634.66, A boat was like a cart.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2225,,
9634.66,9636.1, A cart belonged to a woman.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3956,,
9636.1,9637.34, It was a floating cart.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2778,,
9637.34,9639.7, I am not going over on a floating cart.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3412,,
9639.7,9642.94, I'm gonna ride a goat skin across the river.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2546,,
9643.94,9646.94, So he's assigned one detachment.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4976,,
9646.94,9648.58, You have to burn the boats,SPEAKER_00,3,0.235,,
9648.58,9653.58, so the Dai Viet cannot escape when we route the elephants.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3718,,
9653.94,9656.9," Well, the war battle, I mean, got started.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2821,,
9656.9,9658.62, The elephants are running wild.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3494,,
9658.62,9660.26, All kinds of chaos is going on.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4955,,
9661.66,9665.26," The group that sent to burn the boats, they're Mongols.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3145,,
9665.26,9666.78, They wanna go to war.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3018,,
9666.78,9668.42, Why burn a bunch of women's carts?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5406,,
9668.42,9670.22," It's just not, you know, floating.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3944,,
9670.22,9671.46, So they go and join the battle.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3765,,
9671.46,9672.62, They leave the boats.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4575,,
9672.94,9674.820000000002," Well, the Mongols won the battle,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4213,,
9674.820000000002,9676.86, but the Dai Viet forces got on the boats,SPEAKER_00,3,0.351,,
9676.86,9679.22, and sailed back to what's now Hanoi.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3087,,
9679.22,9680.740000000002," And then they evacuated the city,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4599,,
9680.740000000002,9682.86," took all the food, everything out of the city,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4886,,
9682.86,9685.34, and they disappeared into the Delta.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4402,,
9685.34,9686.22, The Mongols arrived.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2612,,
9686.22,9690.58," They conquered, quote unquote, Hanoi, the capital city.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4199,,
9690.58,9692.9, And they had nothing.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4846,,
9692.9,9693.78, They had nothing.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4417,,
9694.78,9695.740000000002, They won every battle.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7262,,
9695.740000000002,9697.06, They lost the war.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.274,,
9697.06,9698.22, They retreated.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4541,,
9698.22,9701.820000000002," Adju was the son of Hengadai,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2623,,
9702.02,9703.62, and he saw all this happen.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5083,,
9703.62,9707.78, And he recognized the importance of water and boats.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5968,,
9707.78,9709.34, And so he knew.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3047,,
9709.34,9712.42, And he spent his time studying the Yangtze River,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3419,,
9712.42,9715.34, and every little river around it and the cities.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6465,,
9715.34,9717.98, And the crucial thing he saw was the cities,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3362,,
9717.98,9721.98," are heavily, heavily fortified on the land side",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4096,,
9721.98,9723.7," because invasion comes from the land,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.258,,
9723.7,9725.78, and they expect this little line of boats,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3659,,
9725.78,9727.58, to protect them on the water.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4029,,
9727.58,9729.78, And so the city walls are weak.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4428,,
9729.820000000002,9731.9, The defenses are weak on that side.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4549,,
9731.9,9733.62, That's where we have to attack.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3259,,
9733.62,9734.98, So how?,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3425,,
9734.98,9738.02," They sent off to the Ilkhanate, to Persia,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4372,,
9738.02,9740.7," where Chinggis Khan, his uncle, was now dead",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3079,,
9740.7,9742.7," and his cousins were ruling there,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3225,,
9742.7,9745.02," or his nephews, we would say, or cousins' nephews.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3492,,
9745.02,9749.02, So they sent over engineers,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3811,,
9749.02,9752.86," to build a special kind of trebuchet, a catapult.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2975,,
9752.86,9755.58, And they had to play around with it to adapt it for a boat,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3175,,
9755.58,9757.78," because they were usually made for stable ground,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4066,,
9757.78,9759.3, but they adapted it for the boat,SPEAKER_00,3,0.466,,
9759.3,9761.3," and for throwing heavy things,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4061,,
9761.3,9764.740000000002, and also for some incendiary bombs.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3634,,
9764.740000000002,9769.62," They developed it, they attacked the first city, it fell.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2723,,
9769.62,9771.06," They attacked the next, it fell.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5665,,
9771.06,9772.820000000002, They had something that was working.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.384,,
9772.820000000002,9776.14," They worked their way down the Yangtze River,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3918,,
9776.14,9779.18, destroying city after city with this navy.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2929,,
9779.18,9780.98, And then the army would move in,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3207,,
9780.98,9782.7, after the navy had broken down.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2166,,
9782.7,9786.06, So this is a catapult on a ship.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3087,,
9786.06,9787.22, Catapult on a ship.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.314,,
9787.26,9788.74," But it's, yeah, we call it trebuchet",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3863,,
9788.74,9790.34, for this type of catapult.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3718,,
9790.34,9792.5, So this is an engineering solution,SPEAKER_01,4,0.4033,,
9793.42,9797.54, for peoples who are deeply uncomfortable with boats.,SPEAKER_01,2,0.3103,,
9797.54,9798.38, Yes.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2993,,
9798.38,9799.5, And they've accepted it.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.509,,
9799.5,9800.34, Yes.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2993,,
9800.34,9802.1, Now it's a great weapon.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7371,,
9802.1,9804.98," It's like it's not, it's no longer a woman's cart.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3462,,
9804.98,9806.26, It's a bow and arrow.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2492,,
9806.26,9808.46, It is a giant bow and arrow.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3403,,
9808.46,9809.3," Yeah, it's fascinating.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.4643,,
9809.3,9812.179999999998," So they go, they hit them hard on the walls",SPEAKER_01,3,0.5229,,
9812.179999999998,9815.78," on the weak side where there's no, the army protection.",SPEAKER_01,3,0.4191,,
9815.78,9816.86, Yes.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2993,,
9816.9,9821.3," And they conquer their way down to Hangzhou,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4809,,
9821.3,9823.22, the capital of the Southern Song.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4127,,
9824.74,9826.38," They've been in power for a long time,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5509,,
9826.38,9831.18," since 970, and now we're already into the 1270s.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4731,,
9831.18,9832.9, That's a long time.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2543,,
9832.9,9834.06, They are dissipated.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4333,,
9834.06,9837.26," They've been had child, they've had imbeciles ruling,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3659,,
9837.26,9839.18, all kinds of things going on.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.442,,
9839.18,9842.86," And at this point, we have a child in command.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5926,,
9843.86,9847.94, But Kublai makes a very strange move.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4733,,
9848.86,9851.22," He says, okay, let's invade Japan now.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4261,,
9854.26,9855.5," They're like, what?",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3325,,
9855.5,9856.34," Wait, wait, wait.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4831,,
9856.34,9858.74, We're fighting against the Song dynasty.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4067,,
9858.74,9861.3," And most people ascribe it to all kinds of things,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4872,,
9861.3,9864.1, but actually I think there was a great logic to it.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4083,,
9864.1,9867.46, One was he had abolished his grandfather's policy,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2921,,
9867.46,9870.66, of defeat and destroy until they are no more.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6386,,
9870.66,9874.02, That was the phrase that was used for their enemies.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2772,,
9874.02,9876.94, And he had replaced it with a kind of mercy policy.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2915,,
9876.94,9879.66," Try to incorporate them into your army if possible,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3446,,
9879.66,9880.94, but be merciful.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3096,,
9880.94,9883.3," He did not want to destroy, and he was not.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5147,,
9883.3,9885.98, He had a lot of defectors coming in.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4008,,
9885.98,9889.22," And because the Mongols prized people with skills,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2874,,
9889.22,9892.22, a lot of very clever people with shipbuilding,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3517,,
9892.22,9894.98, and engineers and these people were flocking,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5046,,
9894.98,9899.42," to the Mongols, whereas the scholars were all hanging out",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3097,,
9899.42,9903.34," in Guangzhou, doing calligraphy and poetry",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4396,,
9903.34,9906.06, and having contests over who could sing or paint.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2854,,
9906.06,9911.06," Or I don't know what scholars do, but they were being scholars.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3413,,
9911.86,9914.22," But they're actually, I think there's a very,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4802,,
9914.22,9918.42," very good reason for invading Japan, several.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.5528,,
9918.42,9922.38, The main one was to cut off the supply of sulfur.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3397,,
9922.38,9925.3, They needed it for gunpowder in the South Song.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3264,,
9925.3,9927.3, They lost their sources in Northern China,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3638,,
9927.3,9928.58, when they were driven out.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.45,,
9928.58,9930.26, They got it from Japan.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2676,,
9930.26,9931.7, It was a great source.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.571,,
9931.7,9933.58, But I think there were other reasons.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5719,,
9933.58,9937.86," If they could trade, they could also perhaps flee to Japan.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3523,,
9937.86,9940.02, And they didn't want that to happen.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2966,,
9940.02,9941.62," And then there's this idea of, you know,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2377,,
9941.62,9944.46, like kill the chicken to scare the monkey.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4315,,
9944.46,9946.02," It's like, okay, we'll go do this.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5666,,
9946.02,9948.38, And then maybe they'll just surrender down there,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4672,,
9948.38,9950.06, if they see us conquer Japan.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2432,,
9950.06,9951.9," Well, it was a total failure.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.7565,,
9951.9,9954.82, You've got a bunch of ships that are mainly great,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3486,,
9954.82,9957.38, on the river and will ride along the coast.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5263,,
9957.420000000002,9960.1, And you're crossing some treacherous water there.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3644,,
9960.1,9964.06, And the Mongols basically just did not know,SPEAKER_00,2,0.396,,
9964.06,9964.98, what they were doing.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4516,,
9964.98,9966.7," Okay, you can arrive with the trebuchet",SPEAKER_00,3,0.7803,,
9966.7,9969.34, and you can throw grenades at the beach.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.579,,
9969.34,9971.18, It's not really gonna do a lot of damage.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5947,,
9971.18,9973.02," It might scare a few horses,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.468,,
9973.02,9974.94, but you're not destroying cities.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3858,,
9974.94,9977.22, And the Japanese cities were more in.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3925,,
9977.22,9978.62, They weren't there on the beach waiting,SPEAKER_00,2,0.319,,
9978.62,9980.7, for Mongols to come invade.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3883,,
9980.7,9982.660000000002, So he failed in that invasion.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3363,,
9982.660000000002,9986.94," So we should say that this is the time of samurai, right?",SPEAKER_01,3,0.2975,,
9987.5,9988.34, In Japan.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2456,,
9988.34,9992.5, So there was never a real test of like battle.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4054,,
9992.5,9993.9," No, there was some fighting",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3506,,
9993.9,9996.62, and the samurai learned some very valuable things.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.565,,
9996.62,9999.66," The samurai had such a ritualized way of,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3276,,
9999.66,10002.54, it's like the Knights of Europe coming out with armor,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4028,,
10002.54,10005.14, that had to be lifted up on a crane onto a horse.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3419,,
10005.14,10007.98," And I mean, it was just craziness, craziness.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4535,,
10007.98,10010.02," The samurai almost at that point,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3051,,
10010.02,10011.58, you ride out in front of your enemy,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3118,,
10011.58,10014.46, and you recite the story of your genealogy.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5705,,
10014.820000000002,10015.660000000002, All right.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.617,,
10015.660000000002,10017.500000000002," Oh, what?",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3966,,
10017.500000000002,10019.94," You know, Mongols, they have no use for that.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3451,,
10019.94,10020.78, They're there to fight.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3676,,
10020.78,10021.9, They're there to win.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.41,,
10021.9,10023.14," But on the other hand,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5037,,
10023.14,10025.98, this was an unknown territory to them,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4916,,
10025.98,10027.580000000002, and the weather did turn against them.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3621,,
10027.580000000002,10031.42, But I don't want to give too much credit to the weather.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5883,,
10031.42,10034.26, I really think that the Japanese defeated them.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4519,,
10034.26,10036.34, The Mongols weren't well-prepared.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.433,,
10036.34,10038.26, Their ships were not very good.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.511,,
10038.26,10040.500000000002, They were defeated in the first invasion.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2682,,
10040.500000000002,10043.18, Could they get off the ships onto the beach?,SPEAKER_01,2,0.3101,,
10043.18,10044.02," Yeah, they did.",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3222,,
10044.02,10046.3, They had some skirmishes or small battles on land.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5499,,
10046.3,10047.34," Yes, they did.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3204,,
10047.34,10050.22, But they didn't successfully complete them.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4181,,
10050.22,10051.18," No, no.",SPEAKER_01,1,0.6619,,
10051.18,10053.58, So they couldn't do their usual Mongol thing.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4828,,
10053.58,10054.42, You're right.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4464,,
10054.42,10056.22," Well, see, they don't have enough horses for one thing.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.426,,
10056.22,10057.18, Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2654,,
10057.18,10060.82, And there were many tactical things,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2681,,
10060.82,10062.22, that they had done incorrectly.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4094,,
10062.22,10063.74, It's the first time anybody had ever tried,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5207,,
10063.74,10066.06, to have such a massive invasion.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3959,,
10066.06,10066.9, Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.2654,,
10066.9,10068.22, So they're just learning the basics,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4544,,
10068.22,10070.14, of what it means to have a navy.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4355,,
10070.14,10072.62, So he has failed to conquer,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3637,,
10072.660000000002,10073.7, and he's thinking like a Mongol,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2326,,
10073.7,10077.06," that you rule those waters and lands,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5906,,
10077.06,10080.18, but he ruled the ocean.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3395,,
10080.18,10081.5, He stopped the trade.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.568,,
10081.5,10083.42, He stopped the supply.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5223,,
10083.42,10085.5, He cut off the possibility,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2778,,
10085.5,10087.9, of the Song dynasty fleeing to Japan.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2476,,
10088.78,10090.62, He won in a certain way.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5341,,
10090.62,10093.7," He lost, but he had won his objective",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3496,,
10093.7,10096.26, of cutting off Southern China.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2637,,
10096.26,10101.1," Also, it gave him navy some experience with the ocean.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4026,,
10101.1,10102.7, And now they were ready to move out,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2924,,
10102.7,10105.26, into the ocean around Southern China.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.238,,
10106.26,10107.86, So they were closing in then.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4058,,
10108.86,10110.38," Aji was in command,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4385,,
10110.38,10113.86," but actually the head command was a man named Bayan,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3566,,
10113.86,10117.5, who was a Mongol who had been raised more in Central Asia.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.254,,
10117.5,10121.94, He was perhaps born close to the Fagana Valley in that area.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3454,,
10121.94,10123.46," We're not exactly sure where he was born,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5164,,
10123.46,10125.1, but he grew up over there.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4925,,
10125.1,10129.3, And then he eventually was living in what's now Iran.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2733,,
10129.3,10132.86, But he came and he took over command of the army.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3326,,
10132.86,10137.18," He was very cosmopolitan, sophisticated, intelligent.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6617,,
10137.18,10139.740000000002," Aji should have been in command,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3309,,
10139.740000000002,10141.3, but Bayan recognized that,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3402,,
10141.3,10144.02, and he and Aji worked together very well.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6127,,
10144.02,10147.500000000002, Aji knew how to fight the war.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3648,,
10147.500000000002,10149.94, Bayan was able to negotiate things back,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3611,,
10149.94,10151.98, with the capital city and handle things.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4981,,
10151.98,10154.18, So Bayan is in command.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3211,,
10154.18,10157.02, And so the generals are deserting the South Song,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2588,,
10157.02,10158.3, right and left.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3447,,
10158.3,10160.22, The artisans are all coming up to join them.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4115,,
10160.22,10161.78, Mongols get paid.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4383,,
10161.78,10165.7, The generals are loading up the boats with all the jewels,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4818,,
10165.7,10168.62, and they grab a couple of brothers,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2609,,
10168.62,10170.98, to the little five-year-old emperor,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5052,,
10170.98,10172.660000000002, and they put them on a boat and they're fleeing.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2585,,
10172.660000000002,10175.340000000002, They even deserted their own families.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6325,,
10175.340000000002,10180.340000000002, The generals were corrupt cowards who fled.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5208,,
10180.420000000002,10184.420000000002," The person left in charge was the Dowager Empress,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2796,,
10184.420000000002,10186.7," an old lady, she had no children.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3438,,
10186.740000000002,10190.66," Xie was her name, the Dowager Empress Xie.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2535,,
10190.66,10192.94, They said she was missing an eye.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3893,,
10193.78,10194.62, She was ugly.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5765,,
10194.62,10196.02, They called her ugly Xie.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6008,,
10196.02,10198.1, That's what they called her at that time.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3157,,
10198.94,10200.78, She was in charge,SPEAKER_00,5,0.422,,
10200.78,10202.58, and she offered the Mongols everything.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6452,,
10202.58,10203.62, I'll give you everything.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6578,,
10203.62,10205.22, Please let the Empress stay.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3355,,
10205.22,10207.7," Okay, even if you demote him to just being a king,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.828,,
10207.7,10208.94, please let him stay.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6229,,
10208.94,10213.38," Bayan said no, total surrender, total surrender.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.9273,,
10213.38,10215.820000000002, So she decided to surrender.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3817,,
10215.82,10218.78," Once he said, yes, we will surrender the capital.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.6574,,
10218.78,10221.3, So Bayan came in with a small group of soldiers.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4482,,
10221.3,10223.38, They looked around and she invited him,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3284,,
10223.38,10226.66, to come to the palace to surrender.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5066,,
10226.66,10230.98," And he said, no, I didn't win this war in the palace.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5432,,
10230.98,10233.78, My soldiers won this war in the field.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7413,,
10233.78,10235.98, You have to come with the emperor,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2522,,
10235.98,10239.1, in front of my soldiers to surrender.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5059,,
10239.1,10240.26, But he did not harm her.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4492,,
10240.26,10243.66, He respected her and there was no looting of the city.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5437,,
10244.66,10248.62," Now later, they take everything in a very systematic way.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3658,,
10248.62,10251.9, They take the archives and all this kind of stuff away.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3837,,
10251.9,10254.22, But there was no wholesale looting and killing of people.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3765,,
10254.22,10255.18, Nothing like that.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4283,,
10256.18,10261.14, So they've taken the capital and she comes out.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3956,,
10261.14,10262.06, She surrenders.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4728,,
10262.06,10264.78, She bows on the ground towards Beijing.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2905,,
10264.78,10267.18, And then she takes the child emperor,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2414,,
10267.18,10270.26, and they slowly make their way.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3298,,
10270.26,10271.34, She was a little bit sick.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5826,,
10271.34,10273.38, It took her a longer time to Beijing.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4045,,
10273.38,10275.78, And they surrender again in a public ceremony,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3114,,
10275.78,10277.46, bowing to the Kublai Khan.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4624,,
10277.46,10279.3, He gives each of them a palace.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.41,,
10279.3,10284.3, He gives them a new title.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4098,,
10284.34,10285.86, He's trying to show the world,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3999,,
10285.86,10288.1, this is the new face of Mongols.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7208,,
10288.1,10290.820000000002, We don't kill off the old people anymore who are ruling.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3752,,
10290.820000000002,10293.820000000002," We're gonna give them a palace, treat them nicely and all.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5954,,
10295.34,10299.62, But the navy that had fled did not defend the city.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3493,,
10299.660000000002,10302.54," Those cowardly generals,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4574,,
10303.62,10307.3," they made the new little boy, seven year old brother,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5199,,
10307.3,10311.26, half brother to the emperor Gong was his name.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3062,,
10311.26,10312.58, They made him the emperor.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6279,,
10314.54,10318.22," Well, they're just floating around on the ocean",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3505,,
10318.22,10323.22, losing all support from city after city.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4895,,
10323.98,10327.02, The Muslims who were controlling the trade,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2344,,
10327.02,10329.82," and controlling many of the ships of that area,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5705,,
10329.82,10332.62," they were Chinese Muslims, but they were still Muslims.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3213,,
10333.78,10335.66, They switched sides to the Mongols,SPEAKER_00,1,0.356,,
10335.66,10337.58, because of the religious freedom thing.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3027,,
10337.58,10338.94, And because they were merchants,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2223,,
10338.94,10340.94, and their status would be raised.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3554,,
10340.94,10344.46, So the Muslims were switching over.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.367,,
10344.46,10346.66, The fleet was kind of a fleet lost,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4309,,
10346.66,10348.3, without a country out there.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2233,,
10348.3,10350.82, They had some loyal supporters some places.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5775,,
10353.5,10355.66, They dropped the emperor in the ocean.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3583,,
10356.66,10359.78, How do you drop the emperor into ocean?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2978,,
10359.78,10362.02, They accidentally spilled him into ocean,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6076,,
10362.02,10365.14," and then they fished him out, but he died.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3547,,
10365.14,10368.98, So fortunately they had one more seven year old half brother.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.468,,
10368.98,10370.3," So on Lantau Island,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3785,,
10370.3,10373.86," exactly where the Hong Kong airport is today,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7082,,
10373.86,10375.9," the new, well, it's not so new anymore,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5291,,
10375.9,10378.94, but I still think it was the new airport on Lantau Island.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4163,,
10379.98,10383.46, So they went there and they had a big coronation ceremony,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3554,,
10384.14,10386.46, but the people there were not supportive enough.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4252,,
10386.46,10389.18," It certainly wasn't Hong Kong then anyway,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3475,,
10389.18,10391.7," the Delta, the Pearl River.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.365,,
10391.7,10395.42, So they sailed out farther south to another island.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4485,,
10395.42,10396.9, And then they took it over.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3313,,
10396.9,10398.38," And of course, the first thing they did was,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2835,,
10398.38,10399.98," well, we have to build a palace.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3206,,
10401.38,10402.22, What?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4124,,
10402.22,10403.14, The Mongols are chasing you,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3779,,
10403.14,10405.3, and you're gonna stop and build a palace?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4158,,
10405.3,10408.06, So these are like the remains of the Chinese.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3165,,
10408.06,10411.06," Yes, the generals and the army and the Navy.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.4963,,
10411.06,10413.22, And that was a real competence issue.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3938,,
10414.14,10415.54, Okay.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.8049,,
10415.54,10416.38, So they're gonna build a palace.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4762,,
10416.38,10419.38, We're gonna protect it with a great wall of the sea.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6203,,
10419.38,10421.82, They chained together the boats across them,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4103,,
10421.82,10423.94, into the harbor.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3782,,
10423.94,10427.02, And they put the palace boat so-called in the middle.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3847,,
10428.74,10432.06, The generals didn't trust their own soldiers enough.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3653,,
10432.06,10433.94, So they made all of them leave the island,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3863,,
10433.94,10436.7, and go to the boats to fight the Mongols.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3892,,
10436.7,10439.1, So Mongols arrived in over and over and over.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3488,,
10439.1,10441.26, They asked them to surrender.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6062,,
10441.26,10443.98," You won't be harmed, all this kind of stuff.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6336,,
10444.98,10447.3, But the Mongols now took over the land.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3677,,
10447.3,10450.26, So they had the water all around them and they had the land.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5276,,
10451.18,10453.94," And once the fighting started,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2421,,
10453.94,10455.7, they could just shoot down from the highland,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2962,,
10455.7,10457.1, right onto the ships.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4839,,
10457.1,10458.82, And they've cut the ships off,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3655,,
10458.82,10462.26, from the fresh supply of wood and water.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4857,,
10462.26,10463.82, So they can't boil rice.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4299,,
10463.82,10466.38, They have to try to eat rice and drink sea water.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.367,,
10466.38,10468.7, They're all sick as dogs out there.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3205,,
10468.7,10473.7, And the leaders refused to surrender.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.7061,,
10473.820000000002,10476.86," The little boy is there, seven-year-old emperor,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3555,,
10476.86,10480.5," Bing was his name, with his pet parrot.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3466,,
10480.5,10482.54, That's the only thing he had left in life,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2997,,
10482.54,10483.78, was his pet parrot.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3101,,
10484.9,10488.5," And then the Mongols, they offered every opportunity,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5781,,

10503.9,10506.1, by letting them capture the emperor.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4151,,
10506.1,10508.34, So first he threw his own wife and children,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3633,,
10508.34,10509.86, into the water to drown.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4566,,

10529.1,10531.46, the cage came undone with the parrot,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3945,,
10531.46,10534.06, and the parrot fell in the water too.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4784,,
10534.06,10539.06, So the seven-year-old boy and the parrot died in the water.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3843,,
10539.46,10542.1, That was the end of one of the greatest dynasties,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5319,,

10598.78,10603.78, If the way you told the story has a very kind of objective,SPEAKER_01,3,0.5001,,
10607.3,10610.38, sort of way of revealing the absurdity,SPEAKER_01,3,0.391,,

10611.820000000002,10614.1, but there's probably the Chinese perspective,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4871,,
10614.1,10617.78, that they tell the story in some kind of maintained honor,SPEAKER_01,4,0.4418,,

10650.86,10653.46," Well, yes, first of all, he had unified China",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2867,,
10653.46,10656.06," in the largest sense of the word with Korea,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2751,,
10656.06,10660.18," Tibet, Manchuria, Mongolia, part of Central Asia.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2507,,
10660.18,10661.7," He had unified it,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2873,,

10665.22,10667.500000000002, They didn't recognize him as the great emperor,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3985,,
10667.5,10669.66, and there was great opposition,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3947,,
10669.66,10671.66, from the golden horde of Russia,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4084,,
10671.66,10674.02," and also from the central region,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2543,,

10683.18,10685.98, These are the different sort of fracturings,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2998,,

10686.82,10688.38, The sons of Genghis Khan.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4437,,
10688.38,10692.18," And only the Ilkhanate was still loyal to him,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2811,,
10692.18,10694.5," but they're so far away,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4145,,
10694.5,10695.9, but now he has a navy.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4271,,
10695.9,10698.9," But this is, I mean, even the four pieces,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3819,,
10698.9,10700.42, the whole thing is gigantic,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6873,,
10700.42,10702.7, and even the pieces are gigantic.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.8156,,
10702.7,10705.58," So, I mean, it's very hard",SPEAKER_01,3,0.4333,,
10705.58,10707.58, to keep an empire of this size together.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5372,,
10707.58,10711.06," Yes, but he had China, it was unified under him",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4116,,
10712.34,10716.1, and then he sent out the first expedition,SPEAKER_00,4,0.223,,
10716.1,10719.22, to sail directly to Persia.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2443,,
10719.22,10722.54," There had been trade all throughout thousands of years,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3136,,
10722.54,10724.94," but it was usually port to port,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5053,,
10724.94,10726.58, different merchants trading goods.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2591,,
10726.58,10731.22," No, he organized a great fleet to send a queen,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3194,,
10731.22,10734.42," or princess to become a queen in the Ilkhanate,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.253,,
10734.42,10737.14, to marry the Ilkhan of Persia.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4521,,
10737.14,10741.38, It's Persia and Azerbaijan and Armenia,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2275,,
10741.38,10744.78," and Iraq and part of Syria, all of that area.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2653,,
10744.78,10748.26," So, he organized this and it so happened",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3363,,
10748.26,10750.9, that Marco Polo was ready to go home,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3236,,
10750.9,10754.06, because they knew Kubla Khan was about to die.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2317,,
10754.06,10756.82," In fact, he only had about one year left to live",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3496,,
10756.82,10758.5, and they wanted to get their riches out,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2584,,
10758.5,10759.82, before they didn't know what's gonna happen.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3099,,
10759.82,10761.54, This is a new dynasty.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7664,,
10761.54,10764.46, They've been in total control of China for one generation,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3256,,
10765.5,10767.82, and they didn't know what was gonna happen.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3277,,
10767.82,10771.02," And also just before that, there had been a bad sign",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4335,,
10771.02,10775.1, because Kubla Khan had tried to invade Japan a second time,SPEAKER_00,1,0.219,,
10775.1,10776.78, and he had failed a second time.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5539,,
10777.66,10780.22," And the second time, I think again,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4423,,
10780.22,10781.86, he had a practical purpose,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4241,,
10781.86,10785.06, and that was he had this whole huge Song army,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4552,,
10785.06,10786.98, that now he's the new enlightened Mongol,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6217,,
10786.98,10788.7, who doesn't slaughter.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3586,,
10788.7,10790.06," So, what is he gonna do?",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3665,,
10790.06,10793.18," They're not reliable, they're not safe.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4453,,
10793.18,10796.34," So, he sends a bunch of them up into the Amur River",SPEAKER_00,3,0.448,,
10796.34,10798.9," of what's now the Russian Far East,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4147,,
10798.9,10801.54," we call Siberian English, but the Russian Far East,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2785,,
10801.54,10802.94, the Amur River.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2899,,
10802.94,10805.1, He sent expeditions up into Tibet,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2866,,
10805.1,10808.26," exploring options up there, but there wasn't enough room",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4702,,
10808.3,10812.18, or enough agricultural area for a huge military colony.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3262,,
10812.18,10816.5, But most of his ships were loaded with former prisoners,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3575,,
10816.5,10821.18, of the war from the Song dynasty and they were not armed.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3869,,
10821.18,10824.1, They had hoes and implements for farming.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3518,,
10824.1,10826.66, He wanted to create obviously,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3668,,
10826.66,10830.9, an agricultural military agricultural farm in Japan,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3629,,
10830.9,10834.14," to help feed Northern China, because it was very important",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4242,,
10834.14,10835.82," just as they were doing with the Amur River,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4969,,
10835.82,10837.82, but it was more complicated.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5878,,
10837.82,10842.82," So, again, they lost, they didn't have it.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4197,,
10842.98,10846.86, And part of the reason is that the expedition was massive,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3363,,
10846.86,10848.94, and they organized it in the Mongol principles,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4878,,
10848.94,10850.38," of left wing, right wing.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3146,,
10851.98,10853.66," This didn't work at sea,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.6268,,
10853.66,10857.74, because the left wing is from Korea.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2812,,
10857.74,10859.62, There's Korean ships built up there.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2951,,
10859.62,10862.38, The right wing is from Southern China mostly,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3669,,
10862.38,10863.86, with ships built down there.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2761,,
10863.86,10865.7," They're not the same, they have a head,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4299,,
10865.7,10867.26, but there's no center point.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4748,,
10867.26,10869.5," Chinggis Khan always had the goal, they called it,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4888,,
10869.5,10873.22," G-O-L, the goal, the center, or Q-O-L, actually,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2491,,
10873.22,10874.7, call it what they do.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5193,,
10874.7,10876.9, He had the center in command.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3577,,
10876.9,10880.5," No, he sent the two without a clear...",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5509,,
10880.5,10882.7," They were arguing with each other, not cooperating,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5561,,
10882.7,10885.3," not helping each other, sabotaging each other.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.7492,,
10885.3,10887.54," They get there and once again, they have the same problems,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2536,,
10887.54,10890.9, even though they've come with lots of grenades this time.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3376,,
10890.9,10892.94," Again, the grenades are exploding,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4193,,
10892.94,10896.66," they're scaring the horses, it's impressive.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5564,,
10896.66,10898.66, And a lot of silk screens are made later,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3429,,
10898.66,10902.94," showing these impressive battles and all, but they lost.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4668,,
10902.94,10906.22," And again, a typhoon happened to be",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2518,,
10906.22,10910.66," the final destruction of the Navy,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3804,,
10910.66,10915.62," but I think Japan had defeated the Mongols, I would say.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4322,,
10916.54,10919.38, Japanese deserve credit for that victory.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5994,,
10919.38,10923.82, And then the sinking of the ships,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5719,,
10923.82,10927.42, was more caused by the typhoon.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4208,,
10927.42,10930.18, But already the Japanese had developed good strategies,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4233,,
10930.18,10931.46, while the Mongols had been away.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3385,,
10931.46,10933.14, They knew how the Mongols fought.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3043,,
10933.14,10936.82, And they knew that at night they could fire flaming arrows,SPEAKER_00,3,0.22,,
10936.82,10938.86," at the ships, set them on fire,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3434,,
10938.86,10940.7, and they were doing great damage.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4033,,
10942.1,10945.78," So again, Kublai Khan lost the invasion of Japan,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4105,,
10947.46,10951.18," but the soldiers were gone, they drowned.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3489,,
10952.18,10955.86," He didn't kill them off, was his deliberate plan,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3343,,
10955.86,10957.74, but the problem was solved.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4622,,
10959.34,10962.42, It's one of those ironies of history,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4117,,
10962.42,10964.54, that it's hard to quite understand.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5188,,
10964.54,10968.02," So this had happened, but then Kublai Khan",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3484,,
10969.42,10971.34," was coming near the end of life,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2386,,
10971.34,10974.42, and Marco Polo and those wanted to get out.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4458,,
10974.42,10977.74," They're ready to go, and Kublai Khan allowed them to sail",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3774,,
10978.54,10982.02," on this expedition with Hexchin was her name,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3159,,

10988.02,10991.38," And so they went, and that began a whole system of trade",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3994,,
10991.38,10993.34," back and forth, back and forth.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5731,,
10993.34,10996.26, Kublai Khan died soon after that.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2781,,

11013.18,11015.34, and he cured him of drinking.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5221,,
11015.34,11018.22," And actually, he was not a drunk later on,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2612,,
11018.22,11022.22," and he was, first he knew, reassembled the Mongol Empire.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4999,,

11023.42,11025.46," The Golden Horde declared loyalty to him,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5842,,
11025.46,11027.1," recognized him as Great Khan,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7887,,
11027.1,11029.14, as emperor of the whole empire.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7535,,
11029.14,11032.18," The Chagatayid of Central Asia,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3444,,
11032.18,11033.94, they declared loyalty to him.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3904,,
11033.94,11036.9, The Ilkhanate was already loyal to him.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2902,,
11036.9,11038.34, They all declared loyalty.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5938,,
11038.34,11040.34," He had reassembled the empire,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2988,,
11040.34,11042.46," and he had the greatest navy in the world,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.713,,
11042.46,11044.86, and he sent out envoys to every place,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5427,,
11044.86,11047.82," they had attacked or traded with to say,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4342,,
11047.82,11051.54," that era is over, we're no longer attacking anybody.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.6784,,
11051.54,11055.34, We're changing from conquest to commerce.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6761,,
11055.34,11057.66, We want to trade with you.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5009,,
11057.66,11059.94," Come to China, bring your goods.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6007,,
11059.94,11061.5, We're gonna trade with you.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3942,,
11061.5,11064.74," He instituted, it was short, unfortunately,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4062,,
11064.74,11068.18," it didn't last forever, I wish it could have,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4241,,
11068.18,11070.9, but it was a great era of the exchange,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3906,,
11070.9,11073.94," of all kinds of things going back and forth,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5747,,
11073.94,11076.3," all the way, actually all the way to Africa,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4223,,
11076.3,11079.94," because from Hormuz, they had connection to Somaliland,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2521,,
11079.94,11082.34," and some people say Kenya already at that time,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2771,,
11082.34,11085.54," I'm not sure, but very wide, very wide.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5065,,
11085.54,11090.54," So technically, he ruled over the largest size,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3318,,
11091.34,11093.820000000002, the Mongol empire ever had.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6776,,
11093.820000000002,11096.86," Yes, but although actually the golden horde of Russia,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.4308,,
11096.86,11098.62," they were quite independent by now,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.452,,
11098.62,11100.38," and he let them be independent,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3113,,
11100.38,11101.7," but they were loyal to him,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4085,,
11101.7,11104.46, and they were still exchanging back and forth,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2756,,
11104.46,11105.740000000002, all kinds of things.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5251,,
11105.740000000002,11109.98, So there were Ossetian soldiers in China.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3856,,
11111.94,11116.26," They had a whole contingent of Ossetian soldiers there,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2776,,
11116.26,11119.7," and from Russia, from the Caucasus areas of Russia.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2908,,
11119.740000000002,11120.98, And how do they communicate?,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3644,,
11120.98,11122.78, Are they using the postal service?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2836,,
11122.78,11126.3, Do you have to literally deliver the letters?,SPEAKER_01,1,0.316,,
11126.3,11131.3," No, over time, those groups started intermarrying with,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3835,,
11132.18,11134.38," they were allowed to intermarry, the Chinese were not,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4541,,
11134.38,11136.78," but they were intermarrying with Mongols,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3867,,
11136.78,11141.06, and they were switching to Mongolian language slowly.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4193,,
11141.06,11143.66," At first, I don't know, it's not clear.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3808,,
11143.66,11147.34," But again, Kubla Khan, thinking in this internationalist way,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.253,,
11147.34,11150.34," said, okay, we need a new alphabet for the world.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5804,,
11150.34,11152.78, Everybody in the world writes with one alphabet.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6133,,
11152.78,11157.1," Chinese, Mongolian, Russian, Arabic, everything.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4213,,
11157.94,11160.42," It didn't work, but he tried it for a while,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4148,,
11160.42,11163.3, and some inscriptions are still there to this day.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4293,,
11163.3,11167.02, And we should maybe briefly mention Marco Polo,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2797,,
11167.02,11168.24, that you've talked about.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4702,,
11168.24,11171.74, So he is this now famous explorer,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3217,,
11171.74,11176.5," that traversed the continent, the Silk Road,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.4544,,
11176.5,11179.46, and then stayed with Kubla Khan for a while.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3293,,
11179.46,11182.98, And I guess one is one of the primary documenters,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3635,,
11182.98,11185.34, of everything that's been going on.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6171,,
11185.34,11187.78, Is there something else interesting to say,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4519,,
11187.78,11192.54, about Marco Polo and about his interaction with Kubla Khan?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3123,,
11192.54,11193.9, I like Marco Polo.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.48,,
11193.9,11197.62, I use his work a lot.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4995,,
11197.62,11199.5," I find him very reliable,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4815,,
11199.5,11200.98," and the areas where he's not reliable,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4452,,
11200.98,11205.58," you can kind of tell because he wasn't there,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3803,,
11205.58,11208.54," but the places he was, he reported a lot of stuff.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5102,,
11208.54,11212.7, And so I'm very much indebted to him for a lot of things,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4323,,
11212.7,11216.1," because with something like the Princess Huk Jin,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2508,,
11216.1,11218.42, and also another fighting princess,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4703,,
11218.42,11220.7," from Central Asia named Hutilung,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2348,,
11220.7,11224.14," he wrote about that, but I also needed other sources.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4434,,
11224.14,11227.14, So if I could find Chinese sources or Arab sources,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4484,,
11227.14,11229.9," or something else or Persian to support it,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3163,,
11229.9,11234.18, then I really felt a lot of confidence with him over time.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3684,,
11234.22,11236.14," But pieces were romanticized,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5302,,
11236.14,11240.74," and you have to always discount it, but it's very good.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.5989,,
11240.74,11245.74," However, I believe the best work written about Marco Polo,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3696,,
11246.62,11248.02," aside from his own book,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3297,,
11248.02,11250.1," which was actually written by Rusticello,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2805,,
11250.1,11252.9," dictated in prison in January, you know.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5319,,
11252.9,11257.5," In the 20th century, Eugene O'Neill wrote a play",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3518,,
11257.5,11262.5, that became a comedy on Broadway called Marco Millions.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2796,,
11263.02,11266.14," That was both a play on what he was called,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2887,,
11266.14,11269.3," El Milione, the million one,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4959,,
11269.3,11272.7, because he had talked about cities of millions of people,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2764,,
11272.7,11275.1, and about money in the millions,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2435,,
11275.1,11276.26, and things that people in Europe,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5098,,
11276.26,11278.02, just couldn't believe could happen.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.373,,
11278.02,11280.82, He then published his whole play as a book,SPEAKER_00,4,0.292,,
11280.82,11282.86, to show people what he really meant.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4687,,
11282.86,11287.86," And it was an ironic look at capitalism,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2463,,
11288.02,11290.7," because this is 20th century already,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3236,,
11290.740000000002,11294.14," versus the idea of like a philosopher king,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2603,,
11294.14,11297.34, which he saw in Kublai Khan.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4177,,
11297.34,11301.18," And so Marco Polo becomes a symbol of capitalism,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4284,,
11301.18,11304.18," not at its worst, but at its most basic.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.6788,,
11306.98,11309.42," And that is like the princess in the story,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3477,,
11309.42,11310.58," this is not in real life,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5091,,
11310.58,11313.38," but this is in the play written by Eugene O'Neill,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3774,,
11313.38,11315.06, but I think it captures a lot.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4506,,
11315.06,11317.02," The Princess Hoxhaen says,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2426,,
11317.1,11320.82, Marco is an excellent judge of quantity.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7306,,
11322.02,11324.46, And there were things like that.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.28,,
11325.74,11328.98," And then in the play, Bayan, the great general,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3748,,
11330.3,11332.74," he talks with Kublai Khan and he said,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3185,,
11332.74,11335.82," look, these people are dangerous from the West,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.67,,
11335.82,11338.9, we should go conquer them now while we can.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3405,,
11338.9,11341.7," Kublai Khan tells Bayan, again, in the play,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3454,,
11341.7,11344.66," this is fiction, but he tells Bayan,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3369,,
11344.66,11346.74, they are not worth conquering.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4566,,
11346.74,11350.22," And if we conquer them, we will become like them.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4374,,
11350.22,11352.98," And he said, Marco Polo has been in our land,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4725,,
11352.98,11355.82," he has seen everything, he has learned nothing.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.413,,
11356.86,11360.38," He has seen everything, he understands nothing.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5178,,
11361.5,11363.9," For me, this was such an important moment",SPEAKER_00,5,0.8127,,
11363.9,11365.22," in the history of the world,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4456,,
11365.22,11369.94," symbolically with Marco Polo and Kublai Khan,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5637,,
11369.94,11372.02," the coming together of two worlds,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4136,,
11372.86,11375.06," it could have gone a different way,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4288,,
11375.06,11377.5, it could have gone a different way.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4459,,
11377.5,11380.54," And I am, it's not that I'm anti-capitalist,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3117,,
11380.54,11383.94," I'm pro-capitalist, but the way so many things worked out,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3131,,
11385.7,11387.58, it was a misstep in history.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4885,,
11387.58,11390.38, Maybe we took the wrong step at that moment,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3046,,
11390.38,11394.3, and we could have learned more from cooperation.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2873,,
11394.3,11397.06, They didn't quite integrate successfully.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.5229,,
11397.06,11402.06," No, but today, we've returned to that, I think.",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3928,,
11402.3,11405.78," I think the East and the West are confronting each other,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3862,,
11405.78,11408.34," again, on more equal terms.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3899,,
11408.34,11411.22," For a long time, the West was so dominant",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2734,,
11411.22,11414.58, and the East was so downtrodden by colonialism,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3719,,
11414.58,11418.42," and other things, and internal rot and other things.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4503,,
11418.42,11421.46," But today, there's not necessarily equality,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4857,,
11421.46,11423.62, but there's more of a balance.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5435,,
11423.62,11425.78, And which way will we go?,SPEAKER_00,5,0.267,,
11425.78,11430.54," And again, there's a lot of room",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3624,,
11430.54,11434.34," and a lot of energy for division,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.456,,
11434.34,11439.18, for misunderstanding versus integration.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3336,,
11439.18,11444.18," Like, the East is demonized in the West",SPEAKER_01,2,0.3137,,
11444.18,11448.62, and one of the great regrets I have,SPEAKER_01,1,0.4884,,
11448.62,11450.54, that I hope to alleviate,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2953,,
11450.54,11455.54, is just how little I understand China and the East.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4754,,
11455.94,11456.78, Yes.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2993,,
11456.78,11460.42," It's just sort of not just from kind of economics,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.5549,,
11460.42,11463.66," politics, you know, reading a few books,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.2838,,
11463.66,11466.06, but like the way you've understood,SPEAKER_01,4,0.4315,,
11466.06,11468.46," and felt the Mongolian step,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.2698,,
11468.46,11470.58," like understand the Chinese people in that way,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5033,,
11470.58,11474.1," because it does feel like from that understanding,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3188,,
11474.1,11476.9, there could be integration of ideas.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4285,,
11476.9,11480.98," You know, my work is often classified as Chinese history,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3368,,
11480.98,11482.22," which I think is ironic,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3009,,
11482.22,11485.5," because for me, it's always a Mongolian history.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3924,,
11485.5,11487.66," But for the last book I wrote,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4153,,
11487.66,11489.34, which dealt a lot more with China,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3005,,
11489.34,11491.86," because it was about Kublai Khan,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2677,,
11491.86,11494.54," then in that book, I deliberately did not go to China.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.6401,,
11494.54,11496.46, I'd been there numerous times before.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.272,,
11496.46,11497.98, I deliberately did not.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5553,,
11497.98,11499.02, I'm an outsider.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2272,,
11499.02,11500.3, I do not speak Chinese.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5463,,
11500.3,11501.78, I'm not a Chinese scholar.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3482,,
11501.78,11504.3, I never even had a course in Chinese art,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2804,,
11504.3,11506.3, or calligraphy or anything.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2939,,
11506.3,11507.78, And I wanted to be very clear.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3498,,
11507.78,11510.74, Mine is an outside perspective.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2518,,
11510.74,11513.5, But I think it's possible as an outsider,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5432,,
11513.5,11517.54, to still have respect for that culture.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.515,,
11517.54,11520.9, Even if I disagree that they point this one as a hero,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3197,,
11520.9,11523.14," and that one's as the villain, I disagree.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4145,,
11523.14,11524.46," And they'll say, oh, I'm wrong.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4458,,
11524.46,11525.54, I don't understand their history.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4291,,
11525.54,11526.46, And they're probably right.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4224,,
11526.46,11527.58, That's quite possible.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5956,,
11527.58,11531.82, But this is an outside view that is different,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4675,,
11531.82,11533.7, and tries to be respectful,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4642,,
11533.7,11536.06, of what happens in that part of the world.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5371,,
11536.06,11538.42, Just as I'm respectful towards Chinggis Khan,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5857,,
11538.42,11543.42," and the Mongol Empire, I respect China very much.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6762,,
11543.42,11544.74, I'm an American.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3515,,
11544.74,11547.14, I love the ideals of my country.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7898,,
11547.14,11550.3, I love so many aspects of our culture.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.8455,,
11550.3,11552.78," And there are many aspects I don't, of course,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.415,,
11552.78,11555.82, because it's impossible to love everything,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4373,,
11555.82,11558.74, even about the members of your own family.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.505,,
11558.74,11563.74, And I do hope that through understanding one another,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4023,,
11563.98,11565.86," or just making the effort to understand,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3181,,
11565.86,11569.54," even if we understand wrongly and we're incorrect in it,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5821,,
11569.54,11573.5, just to make the effort to understand will help us a lot.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4915,,
11573.5,11577.38, And the West has had a long couple of centuries,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3866,,
11577.38,11582.38, of extreme arrogance that they are there to teach the world.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.359,,
11583.3,11587.14, And I sometimes dismayed.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3404,,
11587.14,11589.86, I meet these young people all over the world,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7584,,
11589.86,11592.06, who've come to help.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.484,,
11592.06,11594.54, They're an NGO and they're gonna teach the people,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4516,,
11594.54,11596.98, how to take care of the environment.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4196,,
11596.98,11601.94, They're gonna teach the women how to exercise their rights.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4171,,
11601.94,11604.66, They're gonna bring in micro-financing,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2855,,
11604.66,11606.26, to help liberate people.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4848,,
11608.26,11611.34, We are arrogant beyond words.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6129,,
11612.38,11614.5, And we need to be a little bit more humble,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4884,,
11614.5,11616.98, and try to put ourselves on an equal basis,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4868,,
11616.98,11620.74," with some of these people, not a superior basis.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5509,,
11621.66,11622.74, Beautifully put.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.7959,,
11623.74,11627.34, How did the Mongol Empire come to an end?,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2203,,
11627.34,11628.58, How did it fall?,SPEAKER_01,1,0.4927,,
11631.82,11634.58, Despite the fact that Timuro Jethuhan,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2794,,
11634.58,11638.5," had united the empire, at least symbolically, all of it,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3241,,
11638.5,11641.06," and they had the trade going on,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3652,,
11641.06,11645.62, the Mongols never adapted well to China,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4212,,
11645.62,11648.54, and they began having problems in different areas.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2819,,
11648.54,11650.5," So in some areas of the world,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5821,,
11650.5,11652.58, they became more like the local people.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3404,,
11652.66,11655.1," So in Central Asia, they became Muslim",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3426,,
11655.1,11657.94, and they got more absorbed into that world,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3139,,
11657.94,11661.9, and broke away from the Mongol examples from before.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4432,,
11661.9,11665.9," Russia lingered on longer under Mongol domination,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3545,,
11665.9,11668.22, but it got weaker and weaker over time,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5139,,
11668.22,11670.38," and it was based around the Volga River,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2793,,
11670.38,11673.06, but they weakened to the point that they just became,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4608,,
11674.06,11677.66, a tributary people minority within a Russian empire.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3944,,
11677.66,11682.34, But the Mongols had left the framework for empire for Russia.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3882,,
11682.34,11684.34, That's something the Russians don't want to hear anymore,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2731,,
11684.34,11686.82, than they want to hear me criticize,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3022,,
11686.82,11688.98, the end of the Song dynasty.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3675,,
11688.98,11693.1," But it is true that even yam, yam is the word",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2815,,
11693.1,11694.94, that was used for this postal system,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3063,,
11694.94,11697.66, and that's the ministries today in Russia.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5331,,
11697.66,11700.74," There are many, many other things in Russia.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2531,,
11700.74,11703.9," It's just even malchik, malchin is a herder.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4379,,
11704.78,11707.7, Mal is an animal and chin is a person,SPEAKER_00,1,0.415,,
11707.7,11709.18, who takes care of animals.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4098,,
11709.18,11711.58," You know, it's all kinds of influences in Russia",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2865,,
11711.58,11713.14," that some people want to deny,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2665,,
11713.14,11716.38, but there's always a great powerful strand,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3523,,
11716.38,11720.42, of research and scholarship in Russia,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4244,,
11720.42,11724.1, that supports this understanding of the Mongols,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4578,,
11724.1,11726.62, and I depend on them tremendously.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.619,,
11726.62,11729.66," It's not just Gumilyov is one of the famous ones,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4041,,
11729.66,11731.54, but he was a little bit too romantic,SPEAKER_00,3,0.6914,,
11731.54,11733.22," with his ideas and all,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5327,,
11733.22,11737.1, but I depend upon a lot of the research done,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5724,,
11737.1,11740.22, by Russian scholars and by early German scholars,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2643,,
11740.22,11743.82, in the 19th century under sponsorship of the Tsar.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3601,,
11745.22,11747.1, So I depend on that work.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5133,,
11747.1,11752.02," So you had a great influence there, but it was weakening.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.6488,,
11752.02,11756.9," So bit by bit, 1368, the Mongols had become so weak",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4511,,
11756.9,11760.82," within China that they were overthrown,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3018,,
11760.82,11763.26, but they weren't absorbed into China.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3846,,
11764.54,11769.1, The Mongols had been there since 1215 to 1368.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2264,,
11769.1,11771.74," They packed up, went back to Mongolia.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4451,,
11771.74,11775.34, It was just another seasonal migration.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3296,,
11775.34,11779.02," You know, it was just amazing.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7336,,
11779.02,11781.46," And they said, okay, we're still the Yuan dynasty.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5059,,
11781.46,11783.34, We're not giving you the seals.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4693,,
11783.34,11784.98, We're not acknowledging the Ming,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3772,,
11784.98,11787.18, and they never did throughout the whole of the Ming.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3021,,
11787.18,11788.14," In fact, they went down one time",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4164,,
11788.14,11791.14," and captured the Ming emperor, took him back to Mongolia.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3215,,
11791.14,11793.78," And then they tried to ransom him and the Chinese said,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5516,,
11793.78,11796.66," no, we're going to appoint another emperor.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4262,,
11796.7,11798.46," So the Mongols decided, okay,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5917,,
11799.66,11802.78, the worst thing we can do to the Chinese is,SPEAKER_00,1,0.8648,,
11802.78,11804.9, give them back the old emperor.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3271,,
11804.9,11808.74," So you had two emperors back, okay, let them work it out.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.6622,,
11808.74,11813.34, And the empire just weakened from internal reasons,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4244,,
11813.34,11816.46," for the Mongols, but some external things from nature.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5488,,
11816.46,11818.26, And I think that was the great plague.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3416,,
11819.42,11820.9," You know, everything in history,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5203,,
11820.9,11822.42, everything that's good comes,SPEAKER_00,5,0.506,,
11822.42,11824.82, with something underneath it that's bad.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4742,,
11824.82,11826.02, And everything that's bad seems,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2232,,
11826.02,11827.1, to have something underneath,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3615,,
11827.1,11829.98, that sometimes works out good in a way.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4961,,
11829.98,11834.3," But this great system that united,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5396,,
11834.3,11837.46," it's called the Yam or Orto, Orto,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2912,,
11837.46,11838.62, that united everything.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6947,,
11838.62,11840.62, People could move back and forth quickly.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3062,,
11840.62,11844.58, Then it could also take the plague out of Southern China,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3118,,
11844.58,11846.7, into all parts of the world.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6765,,
11846.7,11848.98, And I do think that's what happened.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3141,,
11848.98,11853.26, And the plague destroyed the Mongol system.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3841,,
11853.26,11855.78, And if all of these people are ruled by Mongols,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2964,,
11855.78,11859.18," because they're benefiting so much from this system,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.602,,
11859.18,11860.78," and now the system collapses,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4499,,
11861.94,11865.820000000002, you don't need the empire anymore.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4017,,
11865.820000000002,11868.5," So it just fell apart after 1368,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4549,,
11868.5,11870.58, the empire just fell apart.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5015,,
11870.58,11875.58," And most of them stayed in Persia and Iran and Afghanistan,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2744,,
11878.34,11881.34, the Hazara people are still descended from the army there.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2809,,
11882.34,11885.74," And then in Russia, some of them stayed.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3459,,
11885.74,11888.38," But then finally, in the time of Catherine the Great,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3259,,
11888.38,11890.34, a lot of them were returned.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4297,,
11890.34,11893.58," Little pair, they had been there for hundreds of years.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3325,,
11893.58,11898.58, And then they returned to Mongolia in the 1700s.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.285,,
11899.02,11902.26, And so many Mongols came home.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3133,,
11902.26,11903.58, They were still Mongols.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3151,,
11903.58,11907.74," Despite hundreds of years of exposure to other cultures,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2605,,
11907.74,11910.66, they came back to their tent and squatting around the fire.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3703,,
11911.34,11914.74, Drinking fermented milk and eating dried curds.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3441,,
11914.74,11918.5, It's interesting that the Mongolian spirit,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3519,,
11918.5,11923.5, is so strong that it persists through centuries.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.7065,,
11924.22,11927.78," And they just return right back on the horse,",SPEAKER_01,1,0.4636,,
11927.78,11929.66, riding in the open step.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3899,,
11929.66,11932.1," Yeah, well, it was actually very difficult",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4429,,
11932.1,11934.54, because they were a little bit lazy,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5258,,
11934.54,11937.06, and they weren't so good with doing the task.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4948,,
11937.06,11940.02, And so it became difficult actually,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3976,,
11940.06,11942.34, to support so many people coming home,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5528,,
11943.98,11945.7, and eating up all the animals.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5994,,
11945.7,11948.34, The Mongols in China had been used to just eating.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2771,,
11948.34,11951.18, They hadn't been producing much for 150 years.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3739,,
11952.3,11954.9," So just to return to Genghis Khan,",SPEAKER_01,2,0.2823,,
11956.06,11957.74, we talked about Dan Carlin.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3265,,
11957.74,11962.74, And Dan Carlin said that Genghis Khan's army,SPEAKER_01,1,0.2544,,
11963.5,11966.14, was the greatest military force in history.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.8956,,
11967.06,11969.06, And many other historians agree,SPEAKER_01,4,0.2787,,
11969.06,11972.02," that before rifles came into popular use,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.2607,,
11972.02,11976.74," Genghis Khan would basically beat every single army,",SPEAKER_01,1,0.2942,,
11976.74,11979.14, including Napoleon.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4149,,
11979.14,11982.34," And you mentioned the samurai, the whole formal setup,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5155,,
11982.34,11983.38, same with Napoleon.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2966,,
11983.38,11988.38," There's a whole, like several hours to set up",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3478,,
11988.66,11991.14, the chess pieces on the military board.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4264,,
11991.14,11993.74," I mean, you can just imagine what Genghis Khan",SPEAKER_01,3,0.2548,,
11993.74,11998.74," and the dynamism, the speed of everything,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.629,,
11998.74,12000.7, what that would do to Napoleon.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4557,,
12000.7,12005.26, So I guess the question is where do you agree,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4752,,
12005.26,12008.22, with that notion that Genghis Khan's army,SPEAKER_01,4,0.2483,,
12008.22,12010.22, is the greatest military force in history?,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4837,,
12010.22,12013.14," Short answer is yes, absolutely.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.498,,
12013.14,12016.86, No other power in the history of the world,SPEAKER_00,5,0.347,,
12016.86,12021.86, has conquered Russia and China and Persia,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4328,,
12022.22,12026.46, and Central Asia and Turkey and Korea.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3071,,
12027.46,12031.1," No power in the world has done that,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5289,,
12031.1,12033.86," not Alexander, not the Romans.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4,,
12033.86,12035.740000000002, Nobody will ever do it again.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5028,,
12035.740000000002,12038.22, Nobody's gonna conquer China and Russia again,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3739,,
12038.22,12040.26, and rule both countries.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6787,,
12040.26,12041.62, It's just not gonna happen.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3944,,
12041.62,12044.660000000002," What lessons, I mean, can you take from,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.3349,,
12044.660000000002,12047.14, that's applicable to modern warfare?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3589,,
12047.14,12049.14," Oh, I think there's a very good lesson.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4571,,
12051.580000000002,12056.1," The Mongols took Iraq, they took Baghdad, they held it.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3209,,
12056.94,12061.580000000002," The Americans, we followed the exact opposite strategy",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2497,,
12061.580000000002,12062.660000000002, of the Mongols.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3727,,
12063.500000000002,12066.26, Mongol strategy is first you take the countryside.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3314,,
12066.26,12068.740000000002," They're country people, they think in terms of countryside.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4318,,
12068.740000000002,12071.86," You take the countryside, you occupy the countryside",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3257,,
12071.86,12073.580000000002, and you cut off the city.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5087,,
12073.580000000002,12076.820000000002, It cannot live without the countryside.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.305,,
12076.820000000002,12078.7, And that's how they did it every time.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5223,,
12078.7,12080.26," They would come in, as I say, in some cases,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4723,,
12080.26,12082.94, two years in advance to clear people out,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3618,,
12082.94,12084.7, so they would have room for their horses,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5452,,
12084.78,12086.820000000002, and have pasture for their horses and all.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5143,,
12086.820000000002,12089.46, And you take the small towns and then the small cities.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.424,,
12089.46,12091.86, And then the last one is the big city.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2347,,
12091.86,12094.54," Americans, they say, no, we're gonna take Baghdad.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5407,,
12094.54,12095.66, We're gonna bomb Baghdad.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3888,,
12095.66,12097.58, We're gonna have this shock and awe.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.8087,,

12604.580000000002,12607.9, for the Mongols to go away again the second time.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3154,,
12607.9,12611.94," And Chinggis Khan told his family, no, except nothing.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3643,,
12611.94,12613.42," And then when they surrender,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3661,,
12613.42,12616.54," you kill the royal family, kill them all.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5048,,
12616.54,12621.46," So that the idea, they were Buddhist people,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3477,,
12621.46,12623.02," the Tanguts were Buddhist,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.299,,
12623.02,12625.820000000002, and the idea was usually you can be reborn,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2754,,
12625.820000000002,12627.78, into your own family.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6065,,
12627.78,12629.820000000002," But he said, no, you kill off the whole family",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3714,,
12629.820000000002,12631.22, so they can't be reborn.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4561,,
12631.22,12633.62, So he died there.,,3,0.3634,,
12633.62,12636.06, How was his successor chosen?,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2389,,
12636.06,12640.06," Oh, the succession issue was always difficult.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4519,,
12640.06,12643.62, He did not have the right to appoint a successor.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3943,,
12643.62,12645.420000000002, That was not the Mongol way.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3494,,
12646.46,12648.06, He could nominate somebody.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3983,,
12649.420000000002,12653.420000000002," So before he set off for the Middle Eastern campaign,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3772,,
12654.420000000002,12656.580000000002," one of his wives said to him,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2655,,
12656.580000000002,12659.3," you know, even the biggest tree falls.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5101,,
12659.78,12661.54, You've got to make a plan,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3013,,
12661.54,12664.26, and talk to your sons about the future.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5471,,
12664.26,12665.1, So he did.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.541,,
12665.1,12666.94, He called the sons together.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3486,,
12666.94,12668.78, So this is Zhuch.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3136,,
12668.78,12670.7, The oldest boy who was born,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3568,,
12670.7,12674.9," while the father was allied with his Anda, Zhumuk.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3134,,
12674.9,12676.9, And he was named visitor Zhuch.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2584,,
12677.86,12681.1, And then the next one was Chagatai.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2831,,
12682.26,12684.580000000002, And the next one was Okudai.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.238,,
12684.580000000002,12687.580000000002, And the next one was Chagatai.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2418,,
12688.42,12692.66," And the next one was Tala, the father of Kublai Khan,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.259,,
12692.66,12695.14, but he was still alive at this point.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3731,,
12695.14,12696.82, So all four of them came.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3748,,
12696.82,12698.5," So Chinggis Khan explained to them,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3217,,
12698.5,12700.74, he wanted to talk about the succession,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3587,,
12700.74,12704.1, and to get some consensus from them about the succession.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3899,,
12704.1,12708.02," And so he said, the Mongols always call on people",SPEAKER_00,5,0.326,,
12708.02,12709.98, to speak by order of age.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3997,,
12709.98,12713.14," They also serve tea or food, anything by order of age.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3571,,
12713.14,12715.7, It's always done that way from then till now.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5869,,
12715.7,12717.86, So he called first on Zhuch.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3878,,
12717.86,12720.46," And he said, what do you say, Zhuch?",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3735,,
12720.46,12722.3, Chinggis Khan favored Zhuch.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2729,,
12722.3,12725.06," This is the one who was questionable paternity,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3037,,
12725.06,12726.62, but he always favored him.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3639,,
12727.820000000002,12730.1, The youngest Tala was too hot-headed.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4605,,
12730.1,12732.1, Okudai was a heavy drinker.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3203,,
12732.1,12735.46, Chagatai was very rigid about the law of the Mongols,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4066,,
12735.46,12738.98," and all, but he seemed to favor Zhuch",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3988,,
12738.98,12742.58," as a more reasonable, good warrior, but reasonable person.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5552,,
12742.66,12745.9," But he called on Zhuch, my son, speak.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3018,,
12745.9,12747.86," Chagatai, the second one,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3003,,
12747.86,12751.82," who believes in Mongol law supposedly, he jumped up.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5231,,
12751.82,12756.22," And he said, this is when he accused his father",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4188,,
12756.22,12759.34," of all kinds of, he said, how can you call on this Mongol,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3199,,
12759.34,12760.7, this mercant bastard?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6141,,
12760.7,12761.86," If you call on him first,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2773,,
12761.86,12764.1, that means you want him to be the great Khan.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4323,,
12764.1,12766.86, He should not be the great Khan of the Mongol Empire.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3539,,
12766.86,12768.7, Is this Mongol Empire or not?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3457,,
12768.7,12771.42," On and on, you know, you can imagine kind of scene.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4493,,
12771.42,12775.06," Well, Genghis Khan is the greatest ruler in the world.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7377,,
12775.06,12779.62, He's sitting there being lectured by his second son.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.427,,
12780.82,12785.38, And this is when he gave that impassioned speech to his.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6282,,
12785.38,12787.74," Now, and actually the way the secret history,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7061,,
12787.74,12791.38, it makes it look like it was his assistant speaker,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3495,,
12791.38,12794.06," who said it, because very often the great power",SPEAKER_00,5,0.344,,
12794.06,12796.7, doesn't say the words directly.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5143,,
12796.7,12798.18," They let somebody else say them for them,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2925,,
12798.18,12799.02, have a spokesperson.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2943,,
12799.02,12800.98," But anyway, I think it was his words",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4122,,
12800.98,12802.74, that I think he said them on that day.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2487,,
12802.74,12805.02," That's what I think of this business of,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3242,,
12805.02,12807.18," you do not know, you are not there.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3161,,
12807.18,12808.98," You know, the stars were moving in the sky,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3549,,
12808.98,12811.94," the head was turning around, the earth was turning over.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5118,,
12811.94,12813.66, You do not know who loved whom.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3248,,
12813.66,12815.46, You do not know who your mother loved.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3152,,
12815.46,12817.34, You do not know what your mother did.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2491,,
12817.34,12819.54," And if I say he is my son,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3428,,
12819.54,12822.38, who are you to say he is not my son?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4344,,
12823.66,12826.66," By the way, pretty just really high integrity,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.3628,,
12827.06,12829.5, really respectable to do that.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.7012,,
12829.5,12834.5, To have that respect and honor his wife in this way,SPEAKER_01,5,0.7059,,
12835.5,12837.94, and his son in this way is really powerful.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.7893,,
12837.94,12840.5," I believe that, I don't know if she was alive",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3329,,
12840.5,12841.34, at this point or not.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.3239,,
12841.34,12843.42, We do not have the death recorded.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.358,,
12843.42,12845.74, Mongols are not good at recording death.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4713,,
12845.74,12849.38," They don't, they usually just say somebody finished their age",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4222,,
12849.38,12852.14, or they have some euphemism for it.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4977,,
12852.58,12855.46, But he made that impassioned speech,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2939,,
12855.46,12858.06," and Sagadeh had to submit and he said,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3896,,
12858.06,12862.38," yes, you are a father and we accept what you say,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6071,,
12862.38,12867.38, but a deer shot with words cannot be loaded on a horse.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4069,,
12867.94,12870.82, A deer shot with words cannot be eaten.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.7801,,
12872.66,12876.38, So Chinggis Khan knew.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2839,,
12877.66,12879.22," So he said to the Sangha,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3993,,
12879.22,12881.3," I mean, these are middle-aged men, they're not boys,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3966,,
12881.3,12884.94," but he said to the men, what do you want to do?",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3151,,
12884.94,12886.3, What do you want to do?,SPEAKER_00,5,0.431,,
12886.3,12889.14," And he said, I don't favor Sagadeh",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5123,,
12890.1,12895.1, because of his attitude and the situation.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3784,,
12895.500000000002,12897.86, And Tolo is still hot-headed,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2876,,
12897.86,12901.9, and he actually ended up being drunk and dying early.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3813,,
12901.9,12904.500000000002," So, but the other guys, they said, well, a good day.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5752,,
12904.500000000002,12906.78," They chose him, they chose him, they chose him.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3338,,
12906.78,12908.62," The other guys, they said, well, a good day.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4483,,
12908.62,12912.5, They chose him because he was the most generous,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2594,,
12912.5,12915.98, and the bon vivant and he was for every party,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7079,,
12915.98,12918.14, and drinking every time.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7327,,
12918.14,12922.1," And yeah, one time, Chigi Hutuk, the great judge",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4743,,
12922.1,12923.66," who wrote The Secret History,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3697,,
12923.66,12927.3, Chigi Hutuk was sleeping on a cart one time,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3428,,
12927.3,12928.98," for whatever reason, I don't know what.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4466,,
12928.98,12931.7, I think he also had passed out drunk perhaps.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4023,,
12931.7,12934.38, But a good day came out drunk and grabbed him up,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3872,,
12934.38,12936.06, and pulled him back into the party,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2651,,
12936.34,12937.9, and a good day was a party guy.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4149,,
12937.9,12941.66, And so he was chosen as the next great Han,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5913,,
12941.66,12943.58, of the Mongol Empire.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3726,,
12943.58,12947.82," But fortunately, there was sort of a plan B",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5421,,
12947.82,12952.02," and that Chinggis Khan had set up very powerful women,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2452,,
12952.02,12955.3," his daughters, but also he had chosen wives",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3618,,
12955.3,12959.42," for each of his son, very, very capable wives.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.788,,
12959.42,12961.7," And for a good day, he had a wife.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3793,,
12961.7,12963.1, It wasn't even his first wife.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3558,,
12963.1,12965.58, The first wife would usually be somebody,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3063,,
12965.58,12968.3," closer by certain clan or something,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3551,,
12968.3,12971.82, but he had a very intelligent woman named Dorjin.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4282,,
12971.82,12974.14, And then she was more or less ruling,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4166,,
12974.14,12975.78, in his last few years.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4445,,
12975.78,12979.06," And then after he died, she ruled an empire",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2995,,
12981.02,12982.42, in her own name.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4256,,
12982.42,12985.46, She was the ruler of the greatest empire in the world,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6263,,
12985.46,12986.98, ever ruled by a woman.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6355,,
12987.86,12988.82, It's incredible.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.8035,,
12988.82,12991.7, The genius of Chinggis to set it up that way.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.6565,,
12991.7,12992.78, Yes.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2993,,
12992.78,12997.1," And to not, you know, there's probably",SPEAKER_01,2,0.3849,,
12998.54,13002.1, very widespread discrimination of women at that time.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.4399,,
13002.1,13004.18, And to have not care about any of that,SPEAKER_01,1,0.4391,,
13004.18,13006.62, and just making the right decision,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5798,,
13006.62,13009.820000000002, for like what it will keep the empire together.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4313,,
13009.820000000002,13012.02," And Dorjin was, actually there was peace.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.2878,,
13012.02,13014.26, She stopped all campaigns.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6254,,
13014.26,13015.46, There was peace during her time.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3932,,
13015.46,13018.7, And the women like such as Dorjin and others,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2935,,
13018.7,13021.58, were extremely into economics and trade,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3046,,
13021.58,13024.34," and running these, they had these private corporations",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6705,,
13024.34,13025.46, called orthok.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.277,,
13025.46,13027.7, She was running her orthok and everything.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4045,,
13027.7,13029.94, So she became much more interested in economics,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4885,,
13029.94,13032.46, of the trade and running the empire.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5035,,
13032.46,13033.54, And it was the time of peace.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.649,,
13033.54,13036.82, And she recognized that peace was better for trade.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.402,,
13036.82,13037.86, It was better.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4717,,
13037.86,13040.1, And so it was a peaceful time.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3988,,
13040.1,13043.86," But like all of us, you know, we have our weak points",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4737,,
13043.86,13048.86, and she favored a worthless son to become the successor.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3448,,
13049.02,13051.94," And none of the sons actually were great,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3415,,
13051.94,13053.62, but a good they had favored another.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.5042,,
13053.62,13056.98," But anyway, she favored Goyuk, her son.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4369,,
13056.98,13061.98, And so she arranged to have him made the great emperor,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4407,,
13062.78,13064.06, while she was still alive.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.301,,
13064.06,13067.78," And she had a, her primary minister was also a woman",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2955,,
13067.78,13069.78, named Fatima from the Middle East.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2738,,
13069.78,13074.78, And unfortunately Goyuk organized a purge of her court.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5021,,
13075.78,13077.54, And killed off a lot of these people,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6521,,
13077.54,13079.54, who had been supporting her.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2411,,
13079.54,13082.66, And a lot of them were Muslims and he killed off a lot.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4452,,
13082.66,13085.18, And then he was gonna march against the golden horde,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2393,,
13085.18,13086.98, because they weren't supporting him.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4182,,
13088.02,13090.14, So he set off and he died.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3864,,
13090.14,13095.14, He was only in office for 18 months and he was gone.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5481,,
13096.54,13099.54," And then his wife took over, Uncle Kamish.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2433,,
13099.54,13102.58," Unfortunately, she was not capable as her son.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4996,,

13104.66,13106.62, as her mother-in-law at the origin.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4094,,
13106.62,13108.78, Uncle Kamish was a bit greedy,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5324,,
13108.78,13111.54," and she didn't start any new wars,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3027,,
13111.54,13113.82, but she just kind of messed up things,SPEAKER_00,3,0.6805,,
13113.82,13115.26, and she didn't rule for too long.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4952,,
13115.26,13118.74," And this is why Kubla Khan's mother, Sorkhtani,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4176,,
13118.74,13120.62, was able to have a revolution.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.532,,
13120.62,13123.1, She united with the golden horde.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4165,,
13123.1,13125.86," She was on one end on China, she had Northern China.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.352,,
13125.86,13127.46, The golden horde had Russia.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3045,,
13127.46,13130.3, The two of them united against the center,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3029,,
13130.340000000002,13133.580000000002, and they overthrew Uncle Kamish,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4778,,
13133.580000000002,13136.340000000002," and she put her son, Monk Khan, in,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.468,,
13136.340000000002,13138.18, who was succeeded by Kubla Khan.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3001,,
13138.18,13142.78, And we should say probably that this whole succession by kin,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2756,,
13142.78,13145.340000000002, probably goes against the initial spirit,SPEAKER_01,2,0.4052,,
13145.340000000002,13147.86, of what Genghis Khan stood for.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5698,,
13147.86,13148.94," Yes, yes.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3614,,
13148.94,13153.94," In the end, he was a father and he favored his sons,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.396,,
13154.62,13156.740000000002, even knowing they were not so capable.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4654,,
13156.740000000002,13159.02, And he had lost a grandson that he loved.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4477,,
13161.3,13166.3, But he organized it though as what we call today,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5186,,
13166.98,13168.580000000002, almost a corporation.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3172,,
13168.580000000002,13172.86," All lands belong to everybody in the family, everybody.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6061,,
13172.86,13176.26," So Kubla Khan, that's why he had soldiers.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2901,,
13176.26,13179.420000000002," There were Christian soldiers, Ossetian soldiers,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3545,,
13179.420000000002,13180.500000000002, and Kipchak soldiers.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2553,,
13180.500000000002,13183.26," He had 10,000 of each come in.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3853,,
13183.26,13185.38," And then they owned,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.341,,
13185.38,13188.1, the Russians would own silk factories in China.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2788,,
13188.1,13190.18, The Ilkhanid would own silk factories,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2568,,
13190.18,13192.58, and jade mines in China.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3059,,
13192.58,13195.46," The people in China, the Mongols,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3329,,
13195.46,13198.86, they would own villages in Persia and in Iran.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2884,,
13198.86,13201.38, So he organized it all as everything was owned,SPEAKER_00,5,0.363,,
13201.38,13203.86, by the entire clan.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4375,,
13204.94,13206.26, It didn't last too long.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4275,,
13207.66,13210.26, I like that because of the divisions that developed.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.5778,,
13210.26,13215.26, So the great Khan was primarily in charge of conquering,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3491,,
13215.26,13216.58, and expanding the land,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4479,,
13216.58,13219.02, so they had more lands to own.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5238,,
13219.02,13220.46, That wasn't gonna be the job.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4058,,
13222.02,13223.38, And Kubla Khan fulfilled it.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4338,,
13223.38,13225.34, Monk Khan to some extent fulfilled it.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4206,,
13225.34,13226.42," Oh, good they did.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4137,,
13226.42,13227.38, Kuik did not.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4288,,
13228.38,13231.86," It was family ruling the land,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.3201,,
13231.86,13233.26, all the different territories.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4426,,
13233.26,13236.58," Yeah, and they weakened with every generation.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3586,,
13236.58,13237.42, Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2654,,
13237.42,13238.78, Every generation.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7508,,
13238.78,13242.86, But that reminds me of a very popular idea,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3803,,
13242.86,13245.46, about Genghis Khan.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.284,,
13247.58,13250.9, Articulated in the 2003 paper,SPEAKER_01,4,0.2878,,
13250.9,13253.46, titled The Genetic Legacy of the Mongols.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3265,,
13253.46,13257.14, So that paper has a finding that estimates,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4584,,
13257.14,13260.82, that 0.5% of the world's male population,SPEAKER_01,1,0.3458,,
13260.82,13264.86, is direct descendants of Genghis Khan.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3728,,
13264.86,13267.18, I've heard you kind of be a little bit skeptical,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4403,,
13267.18,13271.1," of this paper, but I actually really like its findings.",SPEAKER_01,4,0.5441,,
13271.1,13273.9," I talked to a good friend of mine, Manolis Kellis,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.321,,
13273.9,13278.3," who's a computational biologist and geneticist,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.3645,,
13278.3,13280.06, and he likes the paper as well.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.472,,
13280.06,13282.14," I find it really convincing,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.5119,,
13282.14,13284.58, but I think your skepticism has to do,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4133,,
13284.58,13287.02, not necessarily with the paper's contents,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3825,,
13287.02,13290.5," but more the implication that it speaks to,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.5464,,
13290.5,13293.34, like the thing that maybe the people who think,SPEAKER_01,4,0.378,,
13293.34,13296.1, of Genghis Khan as a brutal barbarian,SPEAKER_01,1,0.2729,,
13298.86,13302.3, assume that the reason it's 0.5% of the population,SPEAKER_01,1,0.3001,,
13302.3,13306.02, is because of some institutionalized mass rape,SPEAKER_01,1,0.3631,,
13306.02,13307.94, conducted by Genghis Khan.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4218,,
13307.94,13311.54," But to me, and we actually spoke about this,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3386,,
13311.54,13315.18, you can't get those kinds of numbers with rape.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.4044,,
13316.38,13321.38," If you want for the empire to propagate the gene,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.2776,,
13322.06,13325.62," if you were a person that wanted to propagate the genes,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.2998,,
13325.62,13328.3, you would make sure that all the lands you conquer,SPEAKER_01,5,0.2773,,
13328.3,13331.420000000002," are stable, flourishing, and happy.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.6929,,
13331.86,13335.7," Actually, this is much better explained in the paper,",SPEAKER_01,2,0.3857,,
13335.7,13338.62," indicates this, is better explained by,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.466,,
13338.62,13343.62," it was of high value, like social status value,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5531,,
13344.3,13348.1, to be associated with the lineage of Genghis Khan.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4216,,
13348.1,13351.38," That means that for many generations,",SPEAKER_01,4,0.2619,,
13351.38,13355.9," people loved the great Khan, the Genghis Khan.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.6237,,
13355.9,13360.62," In that sense, given how vast the land was,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.346,,
13360.62,13364.62," all the transformational effects it has on trade,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5545,,
13364.62,13368.86," on culture, and so on, it makes total sense.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5193,,
13368.86,13373.3," In fact, the 0.5%, just so people understand,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3027,,
13373.3,13375.740000000002, is just male descendants.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.3765,,
13375.740000000002,13380.06," The way it works, that means, if this paper",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3116,,
13380.06,13382.18," is at all correct in its estimate,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.4594,,
13382.18,13384.740000000002," that the number of people descendant,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3456,,
13384.740000000002,13389.3," not direct male descendants, but the way trees work",SPEAKER_01,3,0.5279,,
13389.3,13392.22, is like there's women on each step.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3864,,
13392.22,13396.660000000002, So the number of descendants could be much larger than that.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.5555,,
13396.660000000002,13398.500000000002, So I think that's pretty interesting.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.5878,,
13398.500000000002,13401.340000000002," And I think there's singular figures like this in history,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5929,,
13401.340000000002,13405.580000000002, but none like Genghis.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.3681,,
13405.580000000002,13408.14," It's interesting, it's fun.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.5688,,
13408.14,13410.46, Where did they get the DNA from Genghis Khan?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3669,,
13410.46,13413.9," Oh yes, so one of the criticism you have is like, well.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3166,,
13413.9,13417.14, They don't have one shred of scientific.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.362,,
13417.14,13418.94, They're supposed to be scientific.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3506,,
13418.94,13421.9," No, they found that the bunch of people are connected.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3695,,
13421.9,13422.74, Yes.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2993,,
13422.74,13423.58, And then they.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2217,,
13423.58,13425.74," No, no, no, no, to one person, to one person.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.8093,,
13425.74,13427.38," Yes, but they choose Genghis Khan.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.378,,
13427.38,13428.22, Right.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3182,,
13428.22,13430.5, There's no evidence that it was from him.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3383,,
13430.5,13431.34, No evidence.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4031,,
13431.34,13432.82, It's from that time.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2654,,
13432.82,13433.82, It's one person.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.8611,,
13433.82,13436.38, But from that time or 200 years before.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3189,,
13436.38,13438.26," It could be 200 years before, yeah.",SPEAKER_01,2,0.2784,,
13438.26,13439.1," Yes, yes.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3614,,
13439.1,13442.78," See, I mean, actually, I would like for it to be true",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3875,,
13442.78,13444.34," in a certain way, I would.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5892,,
13444.34,13446.86, And I do think there is a truth there.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3324,,
13446.9,13450.26," I think that by attaching it to the name of Genghis Khan,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.25,,
13450.26,13451.94," they've done a disservice to themselves,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4025,,
13451.94,13454.18, but it gets a lot of publicity and a lot more funding,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5283,,
13454.18,13456.14, and it's exciting and so on.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5468,,
13456.14,13458.66, But I think it's to that Mongol experience.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4214,,
13458.66,13460.26," But Genghis Khan's descendants,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3316,,
13460.26,13465.26," well, almost everyone categorized and recorded.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3812,,
13465.46,13467.74," I mean, he's the largest conqueror in the world.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2271,,
13467.74,13472.34, You do not have just children popping up all over the place.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2451,,
13472.34,13474.02, He had four wives all the time.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2579,,
13474.02,13476.34, He had children with two of them.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3078,,
13476.34,13477.74, So it's not a lot of descendants.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5562,,
13477.74,13481.18, We know mostly who they are for many generations.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3511,,
13481.18,13484.9, His brother Hasser had many more children than he did.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2518,,
13484.9,13485.98, Many more.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3059,,
13485.98,13488.7," And they caused a lot of problems later on for the empire,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3061,,
13488.7,13491.02," too, by rivaling the power.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4499,,
13491.02,13493.06," So it could be that one of these other people,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4216,,
13493.06,13498.06," Bodin Char Deful, could have been the origin of this.",SPEAKER_00,2,0.3486,,
13498.18,13501.42, It could have been back well before Genghis Khan.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4216,,
13501.42,13504.46," I just don't believe, and in Mongolia today,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3549,,
13505.46,13509.38, we have nobody who claims descent from Genghis Khan.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5841,,
13509.38,13512.740000000002," Well, claims is a different thing than biology, right?",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2963,,
13512.740000000002,13517.740000000002, So the reason I say this is this methodology,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2873,,
13517.86,13519.740000000002, is pretty solid.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.6128,,
13519.740000000002,13524.18," Oh, I believe that they found some connection of people.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3616,,
13524.18,13525.1," Yeah, but it's-",SPEAKER_00,3,0.421,,
13525.1,13527.98, They have no evidence that it's really connected,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3528,,
13527.98,13528.9, to Genghis Khan.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3694,,
13528.9,13532.14, I think it may be tangentially connected to him.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5116,,
13532.14,13535.06," Yeah, but it's somebody from the Mongolia region.",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3847,,
13535.06,13536.94," Yeah, I think that's quite possible.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4382,,
13537.86,13539.66, But we've already had the Huns come through.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4551,,
13539.66,13541.5, We've had all the Turks.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3529,,
13541.5,13544.82, Every one of the Turkic nations is descended from Mongolia.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3049,,
13544.82,13546.38, They all came out of Mongolia.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3887,,
13547.7,13548.9," I mean, you're right.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2756,,
13548.9,13549.74, You're right.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4464,,
13549.74,13553.18," Well, on the other hand, I wish they could get some proof.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.6042,,
13553.18,13555.5," I mean, I wish it could be true.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4177,,
13555.5,13558.34, I just can't believe it the way it is.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4078,,
13558.34,13560.5, We have no DNA.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4546,,
13560.5,13562.78, Nobody knows where he went.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3484,,
13562.78,13564.74, So they don't know where he's buried.,SPEAKER_01,3,0.4737,,
13565.78,13569.78," Okay, Genghis Khan said, let my body go.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.7505,,
13569.78,13571.74, Let my nation live.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7176,,
13571.74,13575.42, And he chose to be buried in an unmarked grave.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3321,,
13575.42,13577.86, And the Mongols believe very strongly,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4626,,
13577.86,13579.98, it should always be that way.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3544,,
13579.98,13583.1, Most of the Khans who followed him were also buried,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2413,,
13583.1,13584.38, in a similar way.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3024,,
13584.38,13585.66," The Chinese emperors, you know,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2998,,
13585.66,13588.26," were buried in very elaborate tombs,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2576,,
13588.26,13590.3, but not the Yuan dynasty.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5177,,
13590.3,13591.46, No.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5825,,
13591.46,13595.94, And so Kubla Khan was buried back with his grandfather,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3728,,
13595.94,13598.1, in an anonymous grave.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2981,,

13868.5,13873.38," As a former teacher, I embraced that idea",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4789,,
13873.38,13875.86, out of pure greed and self-interest.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6404,,
13875.86,13878.9," But it's not, to me, the idea of saving the money.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4208,,
13878.9,13881.58, It's the idea of focusing on that,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2841,,
13881.58,13883.9, as something important for the society.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4716,,
13883.9,13887.86," He didn't say tax-free for any other category of people,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4182,,

13898.38,13902.06, That's a profound approach to life.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2917,,
13903.42,13904.62," So these are policies,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3695,,
13904.62,13906.9," and I'm not advocating so much to policies,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4606,,
13906.9,13909.02, but I think some of the general principles,SPEAKER_00,3,0.545,,
13909.02,13913.06, of being willing to learn from our mistakes.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4975,,
13913.06,13915.74," Admit your mistake to yourself,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.287,,

13924.34,13928.54, We don't learn from our failures as much as we think.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2765,,
13928.54,13932.26," The other idea of promoting people on ability,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3018,,
13933.26,13936.94," I think that's certainly an idea that is very valuable,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.417,,
13936.94,13939.06, not in the simple way of meritocracy,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4093,,
13939.06,13940.14," that we've done it with,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4217,,

13941.7,13943.02," you get this or that,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3957,,
13943.02,13946.5, but really evaluating people and their ability.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4471,,
13946.5,13950.42," I think it's a very good thing, not the only thing,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.5642,,
13950.42,13952.46, but I think it's very important.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4456,,
13952.46,13954.14," And even though he failed in the end,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.297,,
13954.94,13958.34," and he turned power over to his sons and his family,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5821,,
13958.34,13961.66," it's a principle that he lived by most of his life,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3867,,
13961.66,13964.26, and we can learn from that principle.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4887,,
13965.1,13967.42, The other thing I think is just his global,SPEAKER_00,3,0.326,,
13968.54,13971.22," feel for the world, his global understanding.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5317,,
13971.22,13975.14," Here was a man who had had no education in any formal sense,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3847,,
13975.14,13978.3, and he had this sense that the world should be united.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5177,,
13978.3,13981.54, We should have things that unite all people.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5127,,
13981.54,13982.98," Everybody should have their own law,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2849,,
13982.98,13986.22, but there should be a higher law of heaven,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4562,,
13986.22,13987.46, that governs people.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.506,,
13988.34,13990.02," And this later was translated,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2258,,
13990.02,13991.38," everybody should have their own language,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2913,,
13991.38,13994.38, but they all write the same alphabet by Kublai Khan.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3059,,
13994.38,13995.22, It didn't work.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6816,,
13995.22,13999.06," Or his idea, he tried to impose the use of paper currency",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3462,,
13999.06,14004.06," in Iran, the Persian Ilkhanate, Chinese paper money.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3294,,
14004.1,14005.1, It didn't work.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6816,,
14005.1,14007.06, The people there weren't used to it.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3066,,
14007.06,14011.46," But all this international spirit of their empire,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3691,,

14017.18,14018.740000000002, It's just incredible.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.8307,,
14018.740000000002,14022.02, And we're more provincial than ever.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.632,,
14022.02,14023.7," We are just so provincial,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2665,,
14023.7,14026.500000000002, and sometimes we use all this technology,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3037,,
14026.500000000002,14029.62, to help preserve our provincialism.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5306,,
14029.62,14032.02, And we can't think in global terms.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2312,,
14032.02,14033.9, We can't think about the world.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2358,,
14033.9,14038.86, It's just amazing to me how narrow-minded we are.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7757,,
14038.9,14043.54, I also saw the Mongol proverb,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2713,,
14043.54,14045.62," of if you're afraid, don't do it.",SPEAKER_01,1,0.3621,,

14051.34,14052.98," I mean, there is something to that.",SPEAKER_01,3,0.372,,
14054.38,14058.62," In many ways, Jengis Khan is a representation",SPEAKER_01,4,0.3947,,
14058.62,14063.62," of a person, like of a self-made man,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.2972,,
14064.62,14066.22, that person from nothing.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.6902,,

14084.54,14085.78, and he had a good wife.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3621,,
14088.3,14091.02, And there were many crucial points,SPEAKER_00,4,0.258,,

14098.7,14101.22," His wife, Burshta, was the one who caused",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2494,,

14123.38,14126.1, It cannot be understated how important,SPEAKER_01,3,0.394,,
14127.18,14131.26, critical women are in the story of the Mongol Empire.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3456,,
14131.26,14132.1, It's fascinating.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4596,,
14132.1,14134.62," Yes, and sometimes we could say",SPEAKER_01,4,0.28,,
14134.62,14135.66, they're not behind the scenes,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3909,,
14135.66,14137.22, because they're always out front.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2921,,

14154.26,14156.02," Okay, yeah, they drink in public.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.8075,,
14159.86,14161.14," So sometimes it was like that,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.499,,
14161.14,14163.26," but other times, as with Dorjin,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4539,,
14163.26,14164.62, she's actually the ruler.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4544,,

14229.42,14231.3," slaughtering an ox with an ax,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.273,,

14234.06,14235.5, You don't do it in the light.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2816,,
14235.5,14236.98, And so they were back there doing that.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3234,,
14236.98,14240.18," And so they raced out with an ax, and they killed the man.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3357,,
14240.18,14243.02, And so then Chinggis Khan was awarding everybody,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2616,,

14244.26,14247.66," And Jebin, they wanted to be rewarded",SPEAKER_00,3,0.277,,

14262.98,14265.58, So he's finished that story in 2.14.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4509,,
14265.58,14266.9," He gets to 2.15, he says,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3163,,

14282.62,14284.5," And I was just so,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2649,,
14284.5,14286.66, and I looked at all these different translations,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3612,,
14286.66,14288.02," of how to different language,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.346,,
14288.02,14291.7," and most often they translated it as,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3043,,

14315.02,14319.46, But the man I give to you goes in the army with me,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3316,,
14319.46,14320.7, and brings his soldiers.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5325,,
14320.7,14321.54, Genius.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7646,,
14321.54,14322.38, You stay here and rule the people.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6831,,
14322.38,14323.78, Brilliant.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.8308,,
14323.78,14325.38," The Chinese, when they arrived in the court",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3275,,
14326.18,14327.26, they didn't know what to think.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3791,,
14327.26,14330.22, There she is ruling this area of the Angut people.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4302,,
14330.22,14331.94," And they said, well, she can read and write,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4284,,
14331.94,14333.54," and she's a supreme judge,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7338,,
14333.54,14335.86, and she doesn't allow any death sentence,SPEAKER_00,1,0.7039,,
14335.86,14337.26, without her permission.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3567,,
14339.78,14342.34, But they didn't say which languages she could read and write.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4078,,
14342.34,14344.62, That has really puzzled me a lot.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4419,,
14344.62,14346.1, So you're saying the secret history,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2636,,
14346.1,14349.580000000002, as we have gotten access to,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5027,,
14349.580000000002,14354.580000000002," has been edited to remove the significance of women,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.2946,,
14354.78,14357.62, even though they're still there.,SPEAKER_01,4,0.3377,,
14357.62,14358.62, In that case.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3565,,
14358.62,14360.5," I mean, other cases with his mother,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4043,,
14360.5,14361.86, they did not and all.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6095,,
14361.86,14363.06," But I think in that case,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5314,,
14363.06,14367.3, because what happened is most of these women,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2207,,
14367.3,14370.82, had few offsprings because their husband was gone to war.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3417,,
14370.82,14373.42," And Altani, of course, she married several times,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3258,,
14373.42,14377.26," sometimes the sons of the last one, you know.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3672,,
14377.26,14379.02, But they were going off to war,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3079,,
14379.02,14380.9, and they weren't reproducing very well.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.5216,,
14380.9,14383.54," Only one, Tsetsekin, who was ruling in Siberia,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2834,,
14384.46,14388.06, she was the one who had a whole bunch of daughters.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.222,,
14388.06,14389.3, They wouldn't be going off to war.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2605,,
14389.3,14391.740000000002, And so they actually spread out through the empire,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2603,,
14391.740000000002,14393.820000000002," and did a lot of, had a lot of power later.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4079,,
14393.820000000002,14398.22," But what happened was the area for al-Qaibbaq,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3682,,
14398.22,14402.46," for example, was then taken over by Kublai Khan.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2898,,
14402.46,14405.26," And then the areas, all the Turkey areas one by one",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3151,,
14405.26,14410.26," were taken over by their nephews as they died out,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2698,,
14410.38,14411.94, not in their own lifetime.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4251,,
14411.98,14413.66, They didn't kill the women off.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2713,,
14413.66,14418.22," But as they died out, the men took it over.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.377,,
14418.22,14420.14, And so then they just wanted to kind of erase it.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5074,,
14420.14,14422.1," It's like, no, Northern China,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.354,,
14422.1,14424.26," even though it was ruled by Tsorakhtani,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2772,,
14424.26,14426.26, it always was Mongol.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2718,,
14426.26,14428.62, She was ruling because her husband was Mongol,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2598,,
14428.62,14429.86," and her sons were Mongol,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3221,,
14429.86,14432.06, therefore they had the right to rule it.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3079,,
14432.06,14434.34, So they cut out the women for those reasons.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5163,,
14434.34,14438.1, I think anytime it threatened the power of a particular man.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3977,,
14438.1,14439.34, Then there were other little things,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3611,,
14439.34,14440.94, that are added in there.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3661,,
14440.94,14442.34, Sometimes you can find a phrase,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3498,,
14442.34,14446.74, and it's like that phrase was not in the original.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.353,,
14446.74,14448.22, Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.2654,,
14448.22,14450.34," In studying human history,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.426,,
14450.34,14453.1, what have you learned about human nature,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5226,,
14453.1,14455.98, and just the trajectory of humanity,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5304,,
14455.98,14459.18, throughout the past several millennia?,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2833,,
14459.18,14463.06," I tend to have a certain love for individuals and persons,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.428,,
14463.06,14465.86," but not a love for people in general,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.61,,
14465.86,14468.54, and especially not for institutions.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4494,,
14468.54,14472.54, I tend to have a great suspicion,SPEAKER_00,3,0.323,,
14472.54,14473.98, about almost everything,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3708,,
14473.98,14477.62, and mistrust in institutions over and over.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4076,,
14477.62,14480.14, And I think that's my own prejudice.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4432,,
14480.14,14483.1, And then I find reasons to support that.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4558,,
14483.1,14484.820000000002, And Chinggis Khan was very good,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4901,,
14484.820000000002,14488.26, at destroying a lot of institutions,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4163,,
14488.26,14491.94, or bringing them to heel within his empire.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2648,,
14491.94,14493.98, So then I like that and I stress that,SPEAKER_00,3,0.394,,
14493.98,14495.740000000002, and I see those things.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5873,,
14497.14,14498.02," I think that's one thing,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2618,,
14498.02,14502.06, but other things that I learned from the Mongol people,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4283,,

14506.7,14509.22, for thousands of years in a place,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4412,,

14525.78,14526.62, It's just open.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3666,,
14526.62,14528.06, There's too much space.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4787,,
14528.06,14529.94," It's like, we need to build something over here.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4562,,

14564.820000000002,14567.22, that Chinggis Khan would return to and love.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5562,,
14568.420000000002,14569.98," If he returned to the capital city,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3224,,
14569.98,14571.500000000002, he would not know where he was.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3899,,
14571.500000000002,14572.78, He would have no idea.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3583,,
14572.78,14574.1," And all the people would just say,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2668,,
14574.1,14575.14, I'll be Mongolian.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.2776,,
14575.14,14576.18, I'm Mongolian.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.3273,,
14576.18,14577.02," Yeah, I'm Mongol.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.397,,
14577.02,14577.98, I have the hat.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.401,,
14577.98,14579.98, I have the bell buckle.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2851,,
14579.98,14582.94, I have all the tail that's all embroidered.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2521,,
14582.94,14584.34," Yeah, I'm Mongol.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.397,,
14584.34,14587.62," And Chinggis Khan would say, where's your horse?",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2234,,
14587.62,14589.18," Oh, keep it in the countryside.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.403,,
14590.22,14593.78," But he wouldn't recognize the city,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4163,,
14593.78,14596.78," but it's still his country, his people.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3661,,
14596.78,14599.42," They worship him in a literal sense,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5771,,
14599.42,14603.34," not the way we would worship God asking for favors,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4,,
14603.34,14606.46, but in the sense of worshiping him with praise.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4318,,
14606.46,14609.34, They have so many songs to praise him.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7125,,
14609.34,14611.34, And about half of the hip hop in the country,SPEAKER_00,2,0.299,,
14611.34,14612.86, is in praise of Chinggis Khan.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4676,,
14613.58,14615.9," You know, it's something we can't understand",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2684,,
14615.9,14619.22," because when we pray, we're usually saying,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3165,,
14619.22,14621.02," oh, thank you God for this and that and the other,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7099,,
14621.02,14622.46, and you're so wonderful and I love you.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.9416,,
14622.46,14624.06," So would you please give me,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3547,,
14624.06,14625.18," and would you please do this,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4165,,
14625.18,14627.86, and would you please stop this pain in my knee?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.273,,
14627.86,14630.18, We're asking for things all over the place.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3847,,
14630.18,14632.46," But Chinggis Khan, no, no.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3274,,
14632.46,14634.22, No one ever asks for anything.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.5839,,
14634.22,14636.22, They just honor him.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6206,,
14636.22,14639.26, They just praise him and honor him.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7448,,
14639.3,14643.06," If I wanted to visit Mongolia, what would you recommend?",SPEAKER_01,3,0.2413,,
14643.06,14645.06, What's the right way?,SPEAKER_01,1,0.2408,,
14645.06,14646.62," Well, start with my home.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5155,,
14646.62,14647.46, Let's start there.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2953,,
14647.46,14648.3, You come over there.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2656,,
14648.3,14650.58, It's a nice valley.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.5536,,
14650.58,14652.42," I mean, I have a nice valley there.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.423,,
14656.1,14658.86, I think almost any direction you go outside of the city,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3377,,
14658.86,14661.06, is going to be interesting.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4343,,
14661.06,14664.74, It kind of depends a little bit on your purpose.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.6477,,
14664.74,14666.54, Most people go south to the Gobi,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3335,,
14666.54,14668.06, and they do a loop to the Gobi,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3298,,
14668.06,14669.74," and around to Karakorum,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2664,,
14669.74,14673.18," Hachor in the old capital from Agudahan,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2902,,
14673.18,14675.42, but it was abandoned by Kublai Khan.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3598,,
14675.42,14677.18, And then they circle back to the city,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3092,,
14677.18,14682.18," and they may stop off to see what we call Preshwalski,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2542,,
14682.18,14686.42," the wild horse, but they call Kach Taki to see the Taki,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3638,,
14686.42,14689.18," or they may go up to Hufskul Lake,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3951,,
14689.18,14692.74," a big beautiful lake, somewhat like Baikal, but much smaller.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.5689,,
14692.74,14695.14, So that's a beautiful trip.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3986,,
14695.14,14697.1, If you want to see the more Turkic area,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3896,,
14697.1,14698.82," where they hunt with eagles,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.3622,,
14698.82,14702.18, the far west is where the Kazakh people live.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3086,,
14702.18,14705.74, And the mountains are absolutely incredibly beautiful.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.9316,,
14705.74,14709.98," Most mountains in Mongolia are gentle, beautiful, but gentle.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.417,,
14709.98,14712.74," The farther west you go, the more dramatic they become,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3797,,
14712.74,14716.26, the more pointed and peaked and snow covered.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4349,,
14716.26,14718.74," Then if you go to the eastern Mongolia,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3393,,
14718.74,14721.14, it tends to be very flat.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4826,,
14721.14,14724.1," There are massive, massive flocks of cranes",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4077,,
14724.1,14725.54, that come in every year.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5835,,
14725.54,14727.62, Millions and millions of cranes.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4234,,
14727.62,14731.740000000002, There are also tundra swans that come in and golden ducks,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3418,,
14731.740000000002,14735.86, and all kinds of beautiful birds out there.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7614,,
14735.86,14738.660000000002, And so each area has something special.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4195,,
14738.660000000002,14742.06," If you want particularly the history of Chinggis Khan,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3135,,
14742.06,14745.820000000002," the Mongolians love him, they worship him,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.7112,,
14745.820000000002,14748.7, but they don't do too much to capitalize,SPEAKER_00,3,0.545,,
14748.7,14752.1," on his home area, the Hinti.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3536,,
14752.1,14753.7, You can go to the Hinti.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3182,,
14753.7,14755.18," There are areas you cannot go to,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2883,,
14755.18,14757.62," large, large areas, it's forbidden.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3671,,
14757.62,14760.54," But you can go, but they don't capitalize like,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.5719,,
14760.54,14761.740000000002, this is the place.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6205,,
14761.740000000002,14766.06," No, they go there themselves out of respect.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4485,,
14768.1,14772.9," But the only one place they built this statue of him,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2846,,
14772.9,14776.38," which is the largest equestrian statue in the world,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6107,,
14776.38,14779.1," but it's the place where they say he found his whip,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4102,,
14780.06,14782.46, which is when he was coming back,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2937,,
14782.46,14786.38, from being at the camp of asking Orgal Khan,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2806,,
14786.38,14789.18, or Torgal Khan or Wang Khan to support him.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.2668,,
14789.18,14791.580000000002, And he's coming back to his family.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4128,,
14791.580000000002,14793.820000000002," And on the way, he supposedly found a whip there,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2977,,
14793.820000000002,14796.94, which is just a small stick with a couple of strands,SPEAKER_00,3,0.404,,
14796.94,14800.1, of rawhide at the end of it that's used.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.284,,
14800.1,14802.9," But for the Mongolians, it's a symbolic thing",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4628,,
14802.9,14805.34, because obviously it's used for the horse.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3681,,
14805.34,14808.38," But for the Mongols, your destiny,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.319,,
14809.34,14814.34," yourself is your himor, your wind horse",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6937,,
14814.62,14816.38, that lives inside of you.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3658,,
14816.38,14820.54, Your wind horse that guides you and gives you opportunities.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.616,,
14820.54,14824.7, But it's up to you to ride that wind horse.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4079,,
14824.7,14827.22," It's up to you to use the wind horse,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4062,,
14827.22,14829.580000000002, not to just go wild with the wind horse.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3061,,
14829.580000000002,14834.02," And so I think it's at that crucial moment,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3344,,
14834.02,14837.660000000002, he's on his way back home and to go with Jamukha,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3292,,
14837.66,14841.7, and the other soldiers to the market to rescue Birsta.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.3289,,
14841.7,14845.58," And so symbolically, he found a whip there.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3299,,
14845.58,14849.22, But I think it means that he found the way,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4637,,
14849.22,14852.86," to control his destiny, his fate.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5877,,
14852.86,14856.34," That's very important, very important.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6589,,
14856.34,14859.7," And that he did, that was the beginning of everything.",SPEAKER_01,5,0.4622,,
14859.7,14862.18," Yes, and it's symbolized in that statue.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4939,,
14862.18,14864.06," Some people think that he's holding this stick,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.4207,,
14864.06,14866.06," that it's a baton or something like that,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.289,,
14866.14,14871.14," but no, it's that what they call a whip, to shoot.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3454,,
14871.34,14873.86, We've talked a lot about the past.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4422,,
14873.86,14876.18," If we look out into the future,",SPEAKER_01,3,0.3024,,
14876.18,14881.18," what gives you hope for human civilization, for us humans?",SPEAKER_01,5,0.3751,,
14882.02,14883.02," Well, almost every day,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.4708,,
14883.02,14886.02, I'm totally dissatisfied with everything on earth.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6647,,
14886.02,14890.3," You know, it's just that kind of old man,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3152,,
14890.3,14891.74," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.5637,,
14891.74,14893.14, What are they talking about?,SPEAKER_00,3,0.2291,,
14893.14,14894.3," My grandchildren are talking to me,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5208,,
14894.3,14896.26, I don't understand a word they say.,SPEAKER_00,2,0.3913,,
14896.26,14897.86," What are they, what?",SPEAKER_00,1,0.3232,,
14897.86,14899.22, And who are they talking about?,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2344,,
14899.22,14901.98," I never heard of this, you know, it's kind of like that.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3178,,
14901.98,14903.420000000002, And who's running for office?,SPEAKER_00,1,0.2409,,
14903.420000000002,14906.78," Oh my God, oh my God, you know, it's everything like that.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5246,,
14906.78,14910.660000000002," But then almost every day, I meet somebody,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3215,,
14911.660000000002,14916.46," just one person, you know, who gives you some kind of hope.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.295,,
14916.46,14919.94," You just see somebody doing something nice and,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.2995,,
14919.94,14922.06, or they do something nice for you.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3655,,
14922.06,14925.86," And I do find in Asia that happens a lot, you know,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.3457,,
14925.86,14930.78, that people just do nice things for old people every day.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.497,,
14930.78,14935.58, And so then my dissatisfaction,SPEAKER_00,2,0.4237,,
14935.58,14937.42, with all the big things in the world,SPEAKER_00,5,0.7217,,
14937.42,14940.22, and the way my grandchildren talk,SPEAKER_00,5,0.6127,,
14940.22,14943.22," and the way young people are,",SPEAKER_00,5,0.512,,
14943.22,14946.66, and then I see something like that.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3531,,
14946.66,14949.22," And often it's something with the young people,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3963,,
14949.22,14950.78, something that the young people do.,SPEAKER_00,4,0.4414,,
14950.78,14955.22," And in an Asian, they're always bringing me things.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.5295,,
14955.22,14957.26," They bring me dried curds,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.2761,,
14957.26,14959.5, they bring me strawberries that they picked,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3565,,
14959.5,14961.54," in the forest in the summer,",SPEAKER_00,4,0.4236,,
14961.54,14966.54," or they bring the pine nuts that they found,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2808,,
14966.78,14971.54," or they bring me the milk in various forms, or yogurt.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2875,,
14971.54,14973.9," Oh yeah, everybody thinks, you got to eat the yogurt.",SPEAKER_00,1,0.2257,,
14973.9,14975.26, This is from my grandmother,SPEAKER_00,5,0.4662,,
14975.26,14978.54, and all the other yogurt in the world is not good.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4591,,
14978.7,14982.14," My grandmother, she knows how to make the best yogurt ever.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6893,,
14983.5,14986.54," And so over and over and over,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.2574,,
14986.54,14991.06," I find despite my all intentions to be in a bad mood,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3905,,
14992.820000000002,14996.42, somebody spoils you with these little nice acts,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5604,,
14996.42,15000.14," that are really very touching, very touching.",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2795,,
15000.14,15001.02," Yeah, and it reminds you",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5846,,
15001.02,15002.78, that there's that little flame of goodness,SPEAKER_01,5,0.4899,,
15002.78,15004.820000000002, that burns in everybody.,SPEAKER_01,1,0.4849,,
15004.820000000002,15007.78, I believe that that on the whole,SPEAKER_01,3,0.2724,,
15007.78,15012.22," will keep humanity flourishing,",SPEAKER_01,5,0.5192,,
15012.22,15016.26, keep evolving and changing towards something better,SPEAKER_01,5,0.3487,,
15016.26,15017.5, with every generation.,SPEAKER_01,5,0.7541,,
15017.5,15018.34, Yes.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.2993,,
15020.54,15023.02, The people in Mongolia take such good care of me,SPEAKER_00,5,0.5843,,
15023.02,15025.18," all the time, all the time.",SPEAKER_00,5,0.6764,,
15025.18,15028.34," And I think my wife had MS,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.2348,,
15028.34,15030.14," I've talked about this before sometimes,",SPEAKER_00,3,0.3224,,
15030.14,15033.06," she had MS and slowly declined for many years,",SPEAKER_00,2,0.4986,,
15033.06,15035.54," becoming paralyzed, not able to speak,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.6759,,
15035.580000000002,15038.78, not able to control her movements or anything.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.4631,,
15039.7,15043.3, And we lived half the year still in Mongolia.,SPEAKER_00,5,0.3285,,
15043.3,15045.5, Part of it was because the climate and the altitude,SPEAKER_00,3,0.3516,,
15045.5,15048.3, were better for her situation.,SPEAKER_00,3,0.5205,,
15048.3,15051.5," It was very helpful for her, but also the people.",SPEAKER_00,4,0.5989,,
15051.5,15055.06," There was a poor country, the sidewalks are broken,",SPEAKER_00,1,0.4765,,
15055.06,15057.34, everything's not working.,SPEAKER_00,1,0.6568,,
15057.34,15059.26, But I would go out with her in a wheelchair alone,SPEAKER_00,3,0.4654,,

15831.14,15833.5, One of the lessons I took from this episode,SPEAKER_01,5,0.5274,,
