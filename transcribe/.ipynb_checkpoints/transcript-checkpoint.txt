[0.00s - 3.24s] The following is a conversation with Jack Weatherford,
[3.24s - 5.32s] anthropologist and historian,
[5.32s - 9.80s] specializing in Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire.
[9.80s - 12.40s] He has written a legendary book on this topic
[12.40s - 15.40s] titled Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World.
[15.40s - 17.88s] And he has written many other books,
[17.88s - 19.68s] including Emperor of the Seas,
[19.68s - 21.84s] Kublai Khan and the Making of China,
[21.84s - 24.04s] Genghis Khan and the Quest for God,
[24.04s - 26.88s] The Secret History of the Mongol Queens,
[26.88s - 29.00s] and other excellent books.
[29.04s - 32.40s] I've gotten to know Jack more after this conversation,
[32.40s - 35.40s] and I cannot speak highly enough about him.
[35.40s - 39.56s] He's a truly brilliant, thoughtful and kind soul.
[39.56s - 43.00s] This was a huge honor and pleasure for me.

[51.60s - 55.44s] And now, dear friends, here's Jack Weatherford.
[56.44s - 60.64s] Genghis Khan, born in approximately 1162,
[60.64s - 62.24s] became the conqueror
[62.24s - 65.44s] of the largest contiguous empire in history.
[65.44s - 69.60s] But before that, he was a boy named Temujin,
[69.60s - 71.94s] who at nine years old lost everything.
[71.94s - 74.44s] His father, his tribe, living in poverty,
[74.44s - 77.56s] abandoned to the harshness of the Mongolian steppe.
[77.56s - 80.62s] From a boy with nothing to the conqueror of the world.
[80.62s - 82.60s] So, tell me about this boy.
[82.64s - 85.68s] His childhood and the Mongolian steppe
[85.68s - 87.16s] from which he came from.
[87.16s - 89.22s] The story of Genghis Khan,
[89.22s - 92.08s] like the story I think of all of us,
[92.08s - 94.64s] it doesn't begin at birth.
[94.64s - 95.96s] That's the beginning of life.
[95.96s - 98.64s] The story begins long before birth.
[98.64s - 101.66s] And sometimes it can be many generations before,
[101.66s - 103.80s] and sometimes only shortly before.
[103.80s - 105.32s] But I think with Genghis Khan,
[105.32s - 109.08s] a crucial thing is to understand how his parents met,
[109.08s - 112.00s] and then how he was conceived.
[112.00s - 114.76s] And that is that one day,
[116.04s - 119.80s] a cart was coming across the Mongol territory,
[119.80s - 121.96s] and only women drove carts.
[121.96s - 124.72s] Men rode horses, women also rode horses.
[124.72s - 126.28s] While women owned the houses,
[126.28s - 128.40s] which were called gears, the tents,
[128.40s - 130.84s] they owned all the household equipment,
[130.84s - 133.32s] and so they had to have carts for moving back and forth.
[133.32s - 135.42s] And the fact that a cart was moving,
[135.42s - 139.16s] meant that some woman was moving from one place to another.
[139.16s - 141.34s] And in fact, her husband was with her.
[141.34s - 142.90s] She was a new bride,
[142.90s - 147.90s] and her husband was on a horse close to her.
[148.98s - 152.78s] So what happened was a man named Yasuke.
[152.78s - 155.94s] Yasuke, the future father of Genghis Khan,
[155.94s - 157.74s] Yasuke was up on a hill.
[157.74s - 159.86s] He was hunting with his falcon.
[159.86s - 161.78s] The words of the secret history of the Mongols
[161.78s - 162.62s] were very clear.
[162.62s - 164.96s] And he looked down and he saw her,
[164.96s - 166.26s] and he could barely glimpse her,
[166.26s - 168.34s] but he knew she was young,
[168.34s - 169.94s] and she was a new bride.
[169.94s - 171.50s] And he rode back to camp.
[171.50s - 175.42s] He got his two brothers, and they came racing down.
[175.42s - 180.42s] And they came, and first the husband of the woman
[181.30s - 184.62s] looked around and he decided to flee.
[184.62s - 186.62s] Not because he was a coward,
[186.62s - 190.42s] but he figured he would probably pull the men after him.
[190.42s - 192.56s] They would chase him, and they did.
[192.56s - 194.74s] They chased him, he went far away.
[194.74s - 197.30s] He circled around, he came back.
[197.30s - 200.62s] He arrived back at the cart where his wife was.
[200.62s - 202.18s] Her name was Erlun.
[202.18s - 206.10s] And Erlun had time to think while he was riding around,
[206.10s - 208.66s] being chased by the Mongols.
[208.66s - 212.86s] And she decided that it's more important for him to live.
[213.74s - 215.82s] And she told him when he came back,
[215.82s - 216.66s] you must flee.
[216.66s - 220.26s] If you stay here, they will kill you and they will take me.
[220.26s - 222.22s] But if you flee, they will take me,
[222.22s - 225.02s] but you will have the chance to find another wife.
[225.02s - 226.86s] There are many women in the world.
[226.86s - 230.98s] You find one and you call her Erlun after my name,
[230.98s - 233.66s] and you remember me when you're with her.
[233.66s - 236.22s] It was a very dramatic moment.
[236.22s - 240.26s] And he rode away, and he looked back and forth,
[240.26s - 242.14s] and it said that the pig tails,
[242.14s - 244.34s] or the braids that were hanging down
[244.34s - 247.78s] were whipping back and forth from his chest to his back.
[247.78s - 252.24s] He was divided, obviously, in whether he should go or stay.
[252.24s - 254.58s] But the three men were approaching again,
[254.58s - 257.18s] and they were headed straight for the cart this time.
[257.18s - 261.42s] And they came in and they took Erlun.
[262.46s - 267.46s] She didn't say a word until her husband was over the ridge.
[267.70s - 269.02s] And when he was over the ridge
[269.02s - 270.94s] and she could no longer see him,
[270.94s - 273.70s] she began to scream and wail.
[273.70s - 275.58s] And one of the brothers said to her,
[276.54s - 279.74s] doesn't matter if you shake the waters out of the river,
[279.74s - 282.54s] and if you shake the mountains with your screaming,
[282.54s - 285.34s] you will never see this man again.
[285.34s - 287.18s] And he was right.
[287.18s - 290.62s] That was the moment that Genghis Khan's mother
[290.62s - 292.66s] and father met.
[292.66s - 296.22s] That's the beginning of his story in this kidnapping.
[296.22s - 298.02s] And it's gonna reverberate.
[298.02s - 302.54s] Every detail of it will come back again and again,
[302.54s - 305.68s] not only throughout the story of the life of Genghis Khan,
[305.68s - 308.38s] but it's gonna continue on with the feuds
[308.38s - 312.46s] and the issues caused by it all the way into the future.
[313.30s - 314.90s] And to some extent in certain parts of the world,
[314.90s - 317.14s] you could say it still exists.
[317.14s - 322.14s] So the meeting is fundamentally sort of a mixture
[322.78s - 327.78s] of heartbreak and dark criminal type of kidnapping.
[328.50s - 332.04s] And from that is conceived this conqueror
[332.04s - 335.50s] of the biggest contiguous empire in history.
[335.50s - 340.10s] What I was really interested in was how did this happen?
[340.10s - 342.14s] Who was this person?
[342.50s - 345.38s] As Wordsworth wrote in his poem,
[345.38s - 347.90s] the child is father of the man,
[347.90s - 350.26s] and it's the childhood that created him.
[350.26s - 354.08s] And it's that episode that was before he was born,
[354.08s - 357.62s] but all the things that happened throughout his childhood
[357.62s - 360.50s] made him into the man that he became.
[360.50s - 365.50s] And so he was now suddenly this unusual situation
[367.46s - 370.62s] was created where a child is going to be born
[370.62s - 373.62s] to a kidnapped woman who is being held
[373.62s - 375.82s] by strange people, the Mongols.
[375.82s - 377.18s] They were not her people.
[378.78s - 382.62s] And he already had another wife or husband.
[382.62s - 384.26s] He had a wife named Sochigul.
[384.26s - 386.28s] He had at that time already one son.
[386.28s - 388.70s] Later he had another son with her.
[388.70s - 390.94s] It was a very odd situation.
[390.94s - 394.48s] And in fact, the father, Yasuke wasn't even there
[394.48s - 396.42s] when Temujin was born.
[396.42s - 398.70s] He was off fighting the Tatars
[398.70s - 400.86s] and doing this campaign against the Tatars.
[400.86s - 403.26s] He killed two Tatars.
[403.26s - 405.80s] One of them was named Temujin Uge,
[405.80s - 408.94s] which is sort of person of iron,
[408.94s - 410.80s] is what it means from the Turkic.
[411.66s - 414.60s] But today, a part of also Mongolian language.
[415.86s - 418.50s] So he came back, he had a baby,
[418.50s - 421.52s] and he decided to name him Temujin,
[421.52s - 424.46s] the person of iron or iron man we might call him.
[424.46s - 425.80s] After the man he killed.
[425.80s - 427.48s] After the man he killed.
[427.48s - 430.46s] So he's a kidnapped mother.
[430.46s - 433.40s] She's a second wife now.
[433.40s - 436.88s] Not a legal wife, but just a second kidnapped wife.
[436.88s - 441.88s] And he's named for someone his father just killed.
[442.00s - 444.52s] It was not auspicious beginning.
[444.52s - 449.34s] And in fact, just episode after episode in his childhood
[449.34s - 450.90s] was inauspicious.
[451.84s - 454.60s] The father and mother moved camp one time
[454.60s - 455.60s] when he was quite young.
[455.60s - 459.42s] And somehow they overlooked him and forgot him.
[459.42s - 461.48s] He was left behind.
[461.48s - 462.78s] So here's this young child.
[462.78s - 463.62s] We don't know what age,
[463.62s - 466.22s] but it could be around four or five, I think.
[466.22s - 467.70s] He was left behind.
[467.70s - 470.76s] And as it turned out, some other people,
[470.76s - 474.02s] the Taichut found him and then they kept him for a while.
[474.02s - 478.14s] And eventually he was reunited with his father and mother.
[478.14s - 483.14s] And it's very odd to me that I never have any inkling
[484.04s - 487.62s] of a spark of relationship much between the father
[487.62s - 488.60s] and the son.
[490.10s - 494.14s] Because then when Timuchin is eight years old,
[494.14s - 497.70s] his father decides to take him off to find a wife.
[497.70s - 500.12s] Which finding a wife in the Mongolian terms means
[500.12s - 501.74s] you give the child to that family,
[501.74s - 503.54s] or you give the boy to that family
[503.54s - 506.14s] and he will live with them and they will raise him up
[506.14s - 508.12s] and they will train him the way they want
[508.12s - 510.66s] before he could marry their daughter.
[510.66s - 514.58s] And so he's taking him off at age eight,
[514.58s - 516.98s] but he didn't take the other son from the other wife,
[516.98s - 517.82s] Bekhter.
[518.84s - 520.56s] He was keeping him.
[520.56s - 523.32s] There was something about Timuchin having been lost once
[523.32s - 526.86s] and found by the Taichut and reunited with the family.
[526.86s - 530.14s] And now his father takes him off at age eight
[531.04s - 534.38s] and he was gonna take him to Erlun's family,
[534.38s - 535.86s] but he never made it.
[535.86s - 537.26s] He stopped with another family.
[537.26s - 539.92s] It's sort of like the first family he came across
[539.96s - 543.26s] and in the words of the secret history,
[543.26s - 545.48s] it's sort of like instant love
[545.48s - 548.80s] that there was fire in his eyes and fire in her eyes
[548.80s - 550.88s] and he saw this girl, Bekhter,
[550.88s - 553.60s] who was about nine years old, a little older,
[553.60s - 556.52s] and he wanted to stay there with that family
[556.52s - 558.48s] according to the story.
[558.48s - 561.48s] And so the father left him there with that family.
[562.52s - 564.10s] But on the way home,
[565.36s - 569.12s] the father decided he saw a drinking party
[569.16s - 570.82s] and he decided to join them.
[571.88s - 573.64s] They were Tatars.
[573.64s - 575.76s] He hid his identity.
[575.76s - 579.76s] On the step, everybody kind of figures out who everybody is
[579.76s - 582.12s] and they figured out who he was.
[582.12s - 586.32s] And supposedly they poisoned him.
[586.32s - 589.60s] He got on his horse and was able to ride back home,
[589.60s - 591.62s] but within a few days he died.
[593.72s - 598.72s] So now Timuchin is off living with another family
[600.12s - 603.04s] and somebody comes from his family,
[603.04s - 606.52s] family, not a relative, but a close person named Mongluk,
[606.52s - 608.62s] comes to get him, take him back,
[610.00s - 612.38s] and they make it through the winter.
[612.38s - 614.02s] They make it through the winter.
[614.02s - 618.92s] Mother Erlum, by now she has four sons and one daughter.
[618.92s - 620.60s] I think the daughter had already been born
[620.60s - 622.52s] or the daughter was going to be born
[622.52s - 624.76s] not too long after that.
[624.76s - 627.32s] But they make it through the winter.
[627.32s - 630.48s] The spring comes and of course the clan
[630.48s - 632.82s] is gonna move to a new camp.
[632.82s - 634.98s] They go to spring camp from winter camp.
[634.98s - 638.48s] And they have a ceremony for the ancestors
[638.48s - 640.04s] and they started the ceremony,
[640.04s - 641.84s] but they did not tell Erlum.
[643.24s - 645.52s] And so she came and she was angry
[645.52s - 647.72s] that she had been left out.
[647.72s - 649.28s] The old women said,
[649.28s - 652.48s] you're the one for whom we do not have to call.
[652.48s - 654.20s] We will feed you if you come,
[654.20s - 657.02s] we do not have to take care of you.
[657.02s - 660.58s] Letting her know that as a captive woman,
[660.58s - 662.80s] she was not a real wife in their view.
[664.02s - 667.30s] And that was really the signal that when they moved camp,
[667.30s - 670.18s] they were not taking her with them.
[670.18s - 673.24s] And they packed up and they took her animals.
[674.74s - 676.18s] They took the animals,
[676.18s - 679.70s] but at that moment she still had one horse for a moment.
[679.70s - 681.08s] And she jumped on the horse
[681.08s - 683.02s] and she took the banner of her husband
[683.02s - 685.30s] and she raced around the people.
[685.30s - 686.66s] And the banner after death
[686.66s - 689.74s] contains the soul of the person, Sult, it's called.
[689.74s - 691.16s] And so she raced around
[691.16s - 692.74s] and they were a little bit nervous.
[692.74s - 694.70s] And so they camped for one night
[694.70s - 697.42s] and they waited until it was dark.
[698.46s - 699.96s] Then they took off.
[699.96s - 703.06s] And this time one of the friends of the family
[703.06s - 705.34s] came running out to try to stop them
[705.34s - 706.42s] and they killed him.
[707.70s - 709.38s] And Temujin cried.
[709.38s - 712.32s] He was a little boy, eight years old.
[712.32s - 713.46s] There was nothing he could do.
[713.46s - 714.80s] He's just a little boy.
[715.54s - 719.78s] And now that family is left there on the steppe,
[719.78s - 722.66s] four children, possibly five already.
[724.10s - 727.12s] Sotchigul, the other woman with two children,
[727.12s - 729.88s] they're all left there to die on the steppe.
[729.88s - 733.32s] When the winter comes, they will surely all die.
[734.54s - 736.70s] How do they make it through the winter?
[736.70s - 740.42s] Mother Erlun, in the words of the Secret History,
[740.42s - 744.10s] she pulled her hat down over her head.
[744.10s - 746.06s] She took her black stick
[746.06s - 749.66s] and she ran up and down the banks of the river,
[749.66s - 754.20s] digging out roots to feed the gullet of her brood.
[755.26s - 757.16s] She fed them through the winter.
[757.16s - 761.58s] She found foods, digging up whatever she could,
[761.58s - 765.44s] finding whatever she could, everything she could.
[765.44s - 766.94s] And even at this young age,
[766.94s - 770.58s] Temujin was already beginning to go out to collect things.
[771.82s - 772.98s] He could get fish.
[772.98s - 776.58s] He could do a few tasks to help feed the family.
[776.58s - 780.56s] It was an extremely awful struggle at this point,
[780.56s - 783.70s] but she saved every one of the children.
[783.70s - 788.70s] So Temujin's early years were marked by loneliness,
[788.82s - 792.46s] abandonment, and struggle?
[792.46s - 797.10s] Yes, even after this, he was kidnapped
[797.10s - 800.34s] at one point by Tai Chiut people.
[800.34s - 803.90s] He was kidnapped and we would say,
[803.90s - 806.20s] I think the correct word, re-enslaved.
[806.20s - 811.20s] They put him into a kank, a yoke, like a ox would wear.
[812.00s - 815.86s] And so his two arms are in it and his head is in it
[815.86s - 818.02s] and he's trapped in this thing.
[818.02s - 821.26s] And every night he would be taken to a different gear
[821.26s - 823.66s] to be guarded by that family.
[823.66s - 826.58s] And one night there was a little celebration,
[826.58s - 828.30s] so most of the people are drinking,
[828.30s - 831.50s] and he's left with a boy who's not very smart.
[832.80s - 835.12s] And Temujin managed to take the kank,
[835.12s - 838.14s] the wooden yoke that he's trapped in,
[838.14s - 841.78s] and use it as a weapon by turning it around very quickly
[841.78s - 844.76s] and hitting the boy in the head, knocking him out.
[844.76s - 846.86s] That was one of the first lessons for the Mongols
[846.86s - 850.86s] that anything that moves is a weapon.
[850.86s - 853.62s] This is gonna go on for generations,
[853.62s - 855.14s] very important for the Mongols.
[855.14s - 856.58s] If it moves, it's a weapon.
[856.66s - 860.22s] He did that, he raced off in the night,
[860.22s - 863.74s] and he jumped into the river to hide.
[863.74s - 865.70s] He's still got a kank on him.
[865.70s - 867.72s] He's still trapped under there.
[867.72s - 869.26s] The people are looking for him.
[869.26s - 871.66s] They come out and they're up and down the river,
[871.66s - 875.34s] and he's hiding underneath the water for the most part,
[875.34s - 877.22s] trying to breathe as best he can.
[877.22s - 880.02s] But it's dark and it protects him a little bit.
[880.02s - 882.02s] They give up and they say, okay, we'll come back tomorrow.
[882.02s - 884.26s] He can't possibly escape.
[884.26s - 888.30s] But the next day he knew one family
[888.30s - 892.40s] that he thought he could go to, and he was right.
[892.40s - 895.94s] He went to that family and at great risk to themselves.
[895.94s - 899.14s] They, in fact, were a captive family of the Tai Chi Yod,
[899.14s - 900.94s] and at great risk to themselves,
[900.94s - 905.02s] they managed to saw off the kank
[905.02s - 907.46s] and then burn it in their fire,
[907.46s - 910.52s] and they gave him food to escape,
[910.52s - 913.58s] and then he had to go find his family again.
[913.58s - 918.58s] So this is the kind of life that this boy, Temujin, had.
[918.70s - 922.26s] So he, just to be clear, the neck is trapped
[922.26s - 923.90s] and the hands are trapped.
[923.90s - 925.34s] We think that's how it is.
[925.34s - 926.98s] We just have the word.
[926.98s - 929.30s] They don't say the head and the hands.
[929.30s - 931.98s] We know that his body is trapped in it,
[931.98s - 936.26s] but from all evidence we have, it's the hands and the head.
[936.26s - 940.54s] And he's running around deeply alone with this thing.
[940.54s - 942.82s] Yes, yes.
[942.82s - 946.22s] And then he has to go out and find wherever his family is.
[946.22s - 950.44s] So this, in part, was the foundation
[950.44s - 952.30s] of his breaking with Mongol tradition,
[952.30s - 956.52s] that kinship is the most important thing above all else,
[956.52s - 958.34s] because here is his life story
[958.34s - 960.70s] where he's abandoned over and over and over.
[960.70s - 963.06s] By his father's own brothers.
[963.06s - 965.88s] See, the men who kidnapped her,
[965.88s - 969.74s] they had an obligation under Mongol law and custom
[969.74s - 973.34s] to marry her when her husband died.
[973.34s - 974.30s] They did not.
[975.54s - 977.74s] They should take care of her and her children
[977.74s - 980.18s] because her children are the children of their brother
[980.18s - 983.50s] and they count as the sons of the clan, or they should.
[983.50s - 985.98s] But no, they had all deserted, all betrayed him.
[985.98s - 989.84s] He learned very early on that you cannot trust family.
[991.14s - 995.32s] You mentioned that Genghis Khan's childhood,
[996.24s - 1000.08s] Timujin, was marked by extreme tribal violence.
[1000.08s - 1005.00s] Can you describe sort of the state of affairs in the steppe?
[1005.00s - 1006.44s] How much violence is there?
[1006.44s - 1008.76s] How much kidnapping is there?
[1008.76s - 1013.76s] The story of Timujin is not a unique story for that time.
[1014.76s - 1018.48s] Now, as an isolated family of outcasts,
[1018.48s - 1022.00s] of course, he's not participating in the various feuds
[1022.00s - 1024.68s] and the raids of the people around him.
[1024.68s - 1027.48s] But they are constantly raiding in the winter.
[1027.48s - 1029.72s] And for women and for horses
[1029.72s - 1032.60s] and for any kind of valuables that they can find,
[1032.60s - 1036.08s] it's almost like their way of getting trade goods from China
[1036.08s - 1038.98s] that one group raids the other in order to find out
[1038.98s - 1043.16s] whatever they have for textiles or for metal.
[1043.16s - 1044.92s] Mongols produced nothing.
[1044.92s - 1048.76s] They could produce felt to make their tents,
[1048.76s - 1050.44s] but they were not craftsmen.
[1050.44s - 1053.24s] And so they had to get these items from somewhere
[1053.24s - 1054.88s] and it was through raiding.
[1054.88s - 1059.00s] And so even in the genealogy of Timujin,
[1059.00s - 1062.04s] you see going back generation after generation
[1062.04s - 1064.12s] of women having been kidnapped,
[1064.12s - 1067.20s] children born who are not necessarily the father's child
[1067.20s - 1070.02s] and it's unclear who the father was.
[1070.02s - 1073.06s] And all of these issues go back for a long time.
[1074.30s - 1076.20s] Later, Genghis Khan will realize,
[1076.20s - 1077.56s] once he becomes Genghis Khan,
[1077.56s - 1079.64s] he will realize that the true source
[1079.64s - 1083.96s] of most of the feuding on the steppe is over women.
[1083.96s - 1087.68s] And later he will outlaw the kidnapping of women
[1087.68s - 1089.56s] and the sale of women.
[1089.56s - 1091.48s] In part, not only because of what had happened
[1091.48s - 1096.36s] to his mother, but what happened to him next in his life.
[1096.36s - 1100.04s] And this is one of the things you talk about this
[1100.04s - 1103.96s] in some ways the love story with his wife
[1103.96s - 1107.90s] was her kidnapping was the defining.
[1107.90s - 1111.26s] If you could point to one place where Genghis Khan,
[1111.26s - 1113.46s] the conqueror was created,
[1113.46s - 1117.02s] it's that point, his wife being kidnapped.
[1117.02s - 1120.98s] Can you describe, first of all, his love for this woman
[1120.98s - 1125.58s] and what that means and what the kidnapping of her meant?
[1125.58s - 1130.38s] At age 16, Berta, the girl he had met
[1130.38s - 1133.06s] when he was eight years old as she was nine,
[1133.06s - 1136.80s] she's now 17 and she and her mother come.
[1138.90s - 1143.90s] It's hard to even imagine what it was like
[1144.34s - 1147.42s] for this 16 year old boy who has suffered
[1147.42s - 1152.06s] these indignities of life in every way that you can imagine.
[1152.06s - 1156.06s] And suddenly here is the love of his life
[1156.06s - 1159.10s] who's gonna be living with him, making him happy.
[1159.10s - 1161.18s] He has somebody who loves him.
[1161.18s - 1163.46s] It's not just his mother running around getting food
[1163.46s - 1165.02s] and trying to feed the five children
[1165.14s - 1168.98s] plus the other wife and her two children.
[1168.98s - 1172.02s] No, he has somebody who loves him.
[1172.02s - 1174.88s] And it's all the excitement that you can imagine
[1174.88s - 1177.98s] with the fire in the eyes and the excitement.
[1177.98s - 1181.66s] And then it only lasts a few months.
[1182.94s - 1184.98s] And so there they are.
[1184.98s - 1186.46s] And there's a lady visiting them.
[1186.46s - 1187.78s] We don't know exactly who she is
[1187.78s - 1190.26s] but just they called her grandmother Khoakchin.
[1190.26s - 1192.02s] Granny Khoakchin is there.
[1192.06s - 1194.34s] Granny Khoakchin is sleeping of course
[1194.34s - 1197.30s] on the floor of the gear, the tent.
[1197.30s - 1201.10s] And early in the morning she feels the vibrations
[1201.10s - 1206.10s] in the earth and she knows that horsemen are coming.
[1206.18s - 1210.34s] She rouses the family and mother Erlun is in charge.
[1210.34s - 1212.02s] Mother Erlun is still in charge
[1212.02s - 1215.02s] even though Temujin is now married.
[1215.02s - 1217.12s] She puts all of her children on a horse.
[1218.08s - 1221.44s] She takes the baby girl Temujin in her own lap.
[1223.48s - 1228.48s] She has one extra horse but she won't take Bersta
[1230.44s - 1232.44s] because she knows, she doesn't know who the men are.
[1232.44s - 1234.40s] She has no idea but they're coming.
[1234.40s - 1235.96s] They're coming in the dark.
[1235.96s - 1237.82s] They're coming for a woman.
[1237.82s - 1239.36s] They know there's a girl there.
[1239.36s - 1242.12s] This family of outcasts has acquired a wife
[1242.12s - 1245.44s] and they know that they're coming for that.
[1245.44s - 1248.96s] And so she leaves Sotchigal, the other wife.
[1248.96s - 1251.24s] She leaves this old lady, Granny Khoakchin
[1251.24s - 1254.68s] who actually has her own cart and she leaves Bersta.
[1255.68s - 1260.12s] They pile into granny's cart and it's only an ox to pull it
[1260.12s - 1264.48s] so they don't get too far before the attackers get there.
[1264.48s - 1266.28s] But mother Erlun is right.
[1266.28s - 1268.80s] She's able to get her children off to the mountain
[1268.80s - 1272.52s] into Burghat Haldun, to the mountainside away from them
[1272.52s - 1275.08s] because the men are so focused on this cart
[1275.08s - 1277.12s] and finding out how many women are in there
[1277.12s - 1279.20s] and who they are and all.
[1279.20s - 1282.92s] So mother Erlun saved her family
[1285.08s - 1290.08s] but at a cost suddenly Temüjin realizes
[1290.84s - 1292.88s] he has obeyed his mother
[1292.88s - 1296.08s] but he's lost the most important thing in his life.
[1296.08s - 1299.82s] And I do think this is the defining moment of his life.
[1300.72s - 1303.58s] The story began back when his mother was kidnapped
[1303.58s - 1306.10s] but now the kidnapping of his wife,
[1306.10s - 1308.02s] I think it's to define what will he do?
[1308.02s - 1308.90s] What should he do?
[1308.90s - 1310.66s] What can he do?
[1310.66s - 1314.38s] Is he going to just resign himself to it?
[1316.30s - 1318.66s] Is he going to go out look for another wife?
[1320.02s - 1322.78s] And he decides that life is not worth living
[1322.78s - 1324.30s] without Bersta.
[1324.30s - 1327.38s] He has found something good in this life
[1327.38s - 1330.78s] and if he has to die trying to get her back,
[1330.78s - 1333.18s] he will die trying to get her back.
[1334.06s - 1339.06s] And this is the early steps of the military genius born
[1339.34s - 1341.66s] because in order to get her back
[1341.66s - 1346.02s] requires an actual organization of troops.
[1346.02s - 1347.30s] He needs allies.
[1347.30s - 1348.30s] Allies.
[1348.30s - 1351.70s] He goes to a man who ruled the Karyat people
[1351.70s - 1354.54s] in central Mongolia on the Tol River
[1354.54s - 1357.66s] about where the capital Ulaanbaatar is today.
[1357.66s - 1360.94s] He goes there because that Vang Han is his name
[1360.94s - 1362.14s] or Torgul Han.
[1362.14s - 1365.34s] He goes there because Vang Han had been the lord
[1365.34s - 1367.70s] over his father at one point
[1367.70s - 1369.70s] and his father had gone on raids for him
[1369.70s - 1371.82s] and so he went there.
[1371.82s - 1373.46s] And actually he took a gift.
[1373.46s - 1377.90s] That's because Bersta's mother had brought a sable coat
[1377.90s - 1382.90s] as a gift for mother Erlun at that time of the marriage.
[1383.54s - 1386.38s] So he took the coat and he took it
[1386.38s - 1390.74s] and he gave it as a gift to Vang Han and asked for his help.
[1390.78s - 1392.34s] And Vang Han said, yes.
[1392.34s - 1395.30s] And he said, I will send some troops, but we need more.
[1395.30s - 1400.14s] And you need to ask Jamukha, Jamukha, Jamukha.
[1400.14s - 1403.94s] You need to ask him to come also.
[1403.94s - 1408.54s] He said, I will send a message to him to get troops.
[1408.54s - 1410.86s] You have to tell the story of Jamukha
[1410.86s - 1414.86s] because the story of Genghis Khan
[1414.86s - 1418.50s] is one of people abandoning him, being disloyal.
[1418.50s - 1421.98s] And here is a person who's not of his kin,
[1421.98s - 1426.98s] but becomes his, in a way, brother, in a way loyal.
[1427.66s - 1431.78s] And as you've described, he's both the best thing
[1431.78s - 1433.82s] to has happened to Genghis Khan
[1433.82s - 1435.98s] and one of the biggest challenges
[1435.98s - 1439.02s] in the later years to Genghis Khan.
[1439.02s - 1441.02s] So who was Jamukha?
[1441.02s - 1446.02s] Jamukha was a boy about the same age as Temujin
[1446.34s - 1448.90s] and his family had winter camp
[1448.90s - 1452.78s] close to where mother Erlun was living with her children.
[1452.78s - 1455.62s] And so the two boys met during the winter time.
[1455.62s - 1458.82s] In fact, they both claimed dissent from the same woman
[1458.82s - 1461.46s] about four generations earlier or five,
[1461.46s - 1462.74s] it's a little unclear.
[1462.74s - 1466.46s] She was Urihanghai woman who herself was kidnapped.
[1466.46s - 1469.74s] And actually Jamukha was the descendant of her
[1469.74s - 1471.66s] from the fact that she was pregnant
[1471.66s - 1473.34s] at the moment of kidnapping.
[1473.34s - 1476.42s] And then Temujin is descended from her
[1476.42s - 1479.50s] through the new kidnapper Botancar, his ancestor.
[1479.50s - 1481.18s] So they're both through the,
[1481.18s - 1483.10s] as the Mongols would say, from the same womb.
[1483.10s - 1487.14s] They come from the same historic origin.
[1487.14s - 1489.50s] However, their lives were similar
[1489.50s - 1491.98s] and they both lost their fathers very early,
[1491.98s - 1494.50s] but Jamukha also lost a mother.
[1494.50s - 1497.50s] So he grew up in the household of his grandfather.
[1497.50s - 1500.74s] He had no siblings unlike Temujin
[1500.74s - 1503.18s] with whole household of siblings.
[1503.22s - 1504.46s] He grew up with his grandfather
[1504.46s - 1506.30s] and his grandfather had several wives.
[1506.30s - 1508.42s] So he grew up with a bunch of old women,
[1508.42s - 1512.94s] which later he said he thought was an influence on his life.
[1512.94s - 1514.62s] But the two boys meet,
[1514.62s - 1516.30s] so they come from different backgrounds
[1516.30s - 1518.50s] and Jamukha is not as deprived by any means
[1518.50s - 1520.10s] as the life of Temujin,
[1520.10s - 1524.10s] but he has a certain emotional deprivation, I think,
[1524.10s - 1526.22s] having not had mother, father, siblings,
[1526.22s - 1528.78s] and he lives with these old, old people.
[1528.78s - 1529.78s] The two boys meet,
[1529.78s - 1532.82s] they become good friends playing on the ice.
[1532.82s - 1534.78s] And so they're playing on the ice.
[1534.78s - 1537.50s] And then very early on,
[1537.50s - 1540.58s] I think when they're about 10 or 11 years old,
[1540.58s - 1542.82s] they decide to make a pact.
[1542.82s - 1545.98s] It's called being coming anda.
[1545.98s - 1547.54s] Anda is more than a friend.
[1547.54s - 1550.10s] A friend is like nukhr in the language.
[1550.10s - 1552.30s] And there are several different types of friendship,
[1552.30s - 1556.22s] but anda is a friendship that's beyond a friendship.
[1556.22s - 1558.06s] It's something for life.
[1558.06s - 1561.86s] And they swore that they would be there forever
[1561.86s - 1563.26s] to protect each other,
[1563.26s - 1565.58s] to help each other in every moment.
[1565.58s - 1567.70s] And they exchanged knuckle bones.
[1567.70s - 1569.46s] So each one of them had the knuckle bone
[1569.46s - 1572.42s] of a roebuck, a deer.
[1572.42s - 1574.90s] Knuckle bones are used in these games that they play,
[1574.90s - 1577.26s] but it's also used to forecast the future.
[1577.26s - 1579.82s] You can roll them around and all.
[1579.82s - 1582.14s] And it's very strange on the ice,
[1582.14s - 1585.66s] I will say in the winter time in Mongolia,
[1585.66s - 1589.38s] it can be up to 50 degrees below zero.
[1589.38s - 1590.82s] And it doesn't really matter at that point
[1590.82s - 1594.34s] whether it's even Celsius or Fahrenheit or what it is.
[1594.34s - 1597.50s] But you slide something across the ice
[1597.50s - 1600.26s] and it's just absolutely smooth like silk.
[1600.26s - 1602.46s] And it goes on for a long way.
[1602.46s - 1605.58s] And if you put your ear down to the ice,
[1605.58s - 1607.74s] you hear this celestial sound
[1607.74s - 1610.46s] that is unlike any sound on the earth.
[1610.46s - 1613.78s] It's just like the angels are singing under the ice.
[1613.78s - 1617.06s] So once they've sworn this relationship of anda,
[1617.06s - 1619.18s] then a couple of years later, they swear it again,
[1619.18s - 1621.34s] but this time they're slightly older boys
[1621.34s - 1622.74s] and they have bows and arrows.
[1622.74s - 1625.54s] And so they exchange arrows with each other.
[1625.54s - 1628.94s] In fact, the text is very specific
[1628.94s - 1631.54s] that Jamukha took the horn,
[1631.54s - 1634.06s] cut it off of a two-year-old calf
[1635.02s - 1637.42s] and he whittled it down.
[1637.42s - 1639.46s] And then he drilled a hole into it
[1639.46s - 1642.02s] in order to make a whistling arrow,
[1642.02s - 1645.38s] which is used for several purposes among the Mongols.
[1645.38s - 1648.10s] It's used for signals for one thing,
[1648.10s - 1649.78s] from one person to another.
[1649.78s - 1651.02s] But also when you're hunting,
[1651.02s - 1654.46s] if you want to move the animal in a certain direction,
[1654.46s - 1657.98s] you send a whistling arrow in the opposite direction
[1657.98s - 1659.02s] to make the animal move.
[1659.02s - 1660.22s] So it had a lot of uses.
[1660.22s - 1662.86s] So the boys had exchanged roebuck knuckles.
[1662.86s - 1664.30s] This time they exchange.
[1664.30s - 1666.66s] And so they had been close friends.
[1666.66s - 1667.74s] And Vang Han said,
[1667.74s - 1672.42s] okay, Jamukha should raise some troops and go with you.
[1672.42s - 1673.70s] And he did.
[1673.70s - 1676.02s] So the three set out some troops from Vang Han.
[1676.02s - 1678.18s] He himself did not go, he was too old,
[1678.18s - 1679.62s] but he sent some troops.
[1679.62s - 1682.22s] And then Jamukha and his troops,
[1682.22s - 1684.98s] and then basically just Temujin and his family.
[1684.98s - 1687.82s] He just had his brothers, that's all.
[1687.82s - 1692.06s] They set off to find the Merkit people up the Seleng River,
[1692.06s - 1696.22s] which flows into Siberia and on into Lake Baikal.
[1696.22s - 1699.58s] They had to go through some extremely rough territory.
[1699.58s - 1703.14s] And you see in this episode though,
[1703.30s - 1708.30s] Jamukha is already a little bit fierce
[1708.94s - 1711.86s] without necessarily thinking it through carefully.
[1713.54s - 1715.90s] He gives this long speech about all the things
[1715.90s - 1717.90s] they're gonna do to the Merkit people.
[1717.90s - 1721.82s] We're gonna jump through the smoke hole
[1721.82s - 1723.06s] in the top of the gear.
[1723.06s - 1725.58s] We're gonna jump in there and we're gonna kill them all.
[1725.58s - 1728.34s] We're gonna kill the men and the women and the children.
[1728.34s - 1730.82s] We will destroy these people forever.
[1730.82s - 1735.26s] He has an extremely militant rhetoric at least.
[1735.26s - 1738.14s] And he's also rather critical of the elder people.
[1738.14s - 1740.38s] Vang Han's people came late
[1740.38s - 1743.70s] and he gave them this long lecture about we are Mongols
[1743.70s - 1748.30s] and if we give our word, our word is our promise forever.
[1748.30s - 1751.74s] And rain or sleet or snow, it doesn't matter.
[1751.74s - 1753.14s] We be there on time.
[1754.42s - 1757.62s] So he's dressing down his superiors.
[1757.62s - 1761.94s] He's very aggressive, but he's very helpful.
[1761.94s - 1765.74s] So these troops, they move in on the Merkit camp.
[1765.74s - 1768.34s] They also come in at night.
[1768.34s - 1771.82s] And so there's a small amount of warning
[1771.82s - 1773.34s] because some men are out hunting.
[1773.34s - 1777.02s] He sables the Merkit men and they race back to the camp
[1777.02s - 1779.94s] and they tell the people and the people are getting ready
[1779.94s - 1782.50s] to get out as fast as possible.
[1782.50s - 1785.10s] So Bershta has no idea who's coming.
[1785.10s - 1786.98s] She doesn't wanna be kidnapped again.
[1786.98s - 1788.74s] She says, somebody.
[1788.74s - 1793.06s] So she and the grandmother go action again.
[1793.06s - 1797.14s] And so she goes, they're loaded into a cart to go away.
[1797.14s - 1801.02s] So Temujin comes in and there's a full moon that night
[1801.02s - 1802.82s] so they could see what they're doing.
[1802.82s - 1805.38s] And he's really searching for her.
[1805.38s - 1808.10s] He's not paying too much attention to the battle.
[1808.10s - 1813.02s] And he's calling for her and she hears his voice.
[1813.02s - 1814.42s] She knows who it is.
[1814.46s - 1817.74s] She jumps off the cart and she runs to him
[1817.74s - 1821.90s] and they're reunited and he grabs her, embraces her.
[1821.90s - 1824.38s] And then he said, this is the goal.
[1824.38s - 1825.90s] This is why we are here.
[1825.90s - 1828.46s] We don't need anything else.
[1828.46s - 1830.26s] He was very clear about that.
[1831.14s - 1836.14s] And that was his first full-on military engagement.
[1838.02s - 1839.38s] Yes, aside from the things,
[1839.38s - 1842.30s] yes, his first full-on military engagement.
[1842.30s - 1847.30s] Now along the way, in addition to escaping all these horrors,
[1847.46s - 1851.74s] he had killed his older half-brother, Begter.
[1851.74s - 1854.78s] And that too was a deeply formative experience.
[1854.78s - 1856.02s] So what was that about?
[1856.02s - 1858.58s] Can you explain in Mongol society
[1858.58s - 1862.94s] the role of the older brother and the power struggle there
[1862.94s - 1866.22s] and not to moralize, but there's also
[1866.94s - 1871.94s] the ethical foundation behind the murder?
[1872.82s - 1874.38s] The killing of Begter,
[1874.38s - 1876.46s] that's one of the things that's totally unknown
[1876.46s - 1879.02s] outside of the secret history of the Mongols.
[1879.02s - 1880.58s] None of the Persian chronicles,
[1880.58s - 1882.46s] none of the Chinese chronicles,
[1882.46s - 1883.82s] none of them knew about this
[1883.82s - 1888.58s] until the secret history was deciphered and translated.
[1888.58s - 1892.90s] But Begter was the older child of Sotchigul.
[1893.90s - 1896.30s] The older brother has complete authority
[1896.30s - 1899.78s] over the younger siblings in Mongolian society.
[1899.78s - 1902.30s] They have to refer to him with a special pronoun
[1902.30s - 1905.86s] all the time, ta, and he refers to them as chi.
[1905.86s - 1908.58s] It's like a formality.
[1908.58s - 1911.30s] And his word goes, he is the father
[1911.30s - 1913.62s] in the absence of the father.
[1913.62s - 1918.62s] But also it's quite common that if a man dies
[1918.86s - 1920.90s] and his brothers, he has no brothers
[1920.90s - 1924.26s] or his brothers do not marry his widow,
[1924.26s - 1927.66s] then if he has a son by another wife,
[1927.66s - 1930.86s] she will become his wife.
[1930.86s - 1933.98s] So it would have been common that Begter eventually
[1933.98s - 1936.14s] when he passed through puberty
[1936.14s - 1939.58s] would then perhaps marry Mother Erlun.
[1941.30s - 1945.46s] Now, I don't know that that happened,
[1945.46s - 1947.58s] but I think either it did
[1947.58s - 1950.78s] or Temujin was trying to prevent it
[1950.82s - 1952.82s] because it was bad enough that he was the older brother,
[1952.82s - 1955.46s] but he becomes the older brother and a stepfather.
[1955.46s - 1957.82s] I think Temujin just couldn't handle that.
[1957.82s - 1961.02s] And he was already, Begter was ordering him around,
[1961.02s - 1963.46s] so he would take things like a fish
[1963.46s - 1966.02s] or a bird that Temujin had caught.
[1966.02s - 1971.02s] And that's perfectly acceptable in the Mongol hierarchy.
[1971.26s - 1973.82s] So Temujin would catch a fish
[1973.82s - 1976.22s] and Begter would take the fish.
[1976.22s - 1977.98s] Yes, it's only recorded once,
[1977.98s - 1979.62s] but perhaps it happened several times.
[1979.62s - 1983.06s] So that's an okay thing to do for an older brother,
[1983.06s - 1984.22s] just take stuff.
[1984.22s - 1985.98s] Yes, he can do anything he wants
[1985.98s - 1988.06s] just about with his younger siblings.
[1991.70s - 1993.62s] But Temujin is not gonna stand for it.
[1993.62s - 1995.90s] So mostly in the record,
[1995.90s - 1999.14s] they kind of put the blame on this fish,
[1999.14s - 2002.06s] which I'm not so sure that's really the blame.
[2002.06s - 2004.70s] And the boys had actually taken the sewing needles
[2004.70s - 2007.54s] from their mother, they were using them for fishing.
[2007.54s - 2011.26s] And I think it's more complicated than that.
[2011.26s - 2012.54s] But for whatever reason,
[2012.54s - 2017.54s] he and his next brother, Hasser, decided to kill him.
[2017.58s - 2018.66s] And they did.
[2018.66s - 2020.98s] Why to you is it more complicated than that?
[2020.98s - 2023.98s] It feels to me like stealing of a fish
[2023.98s - 2025.82s] is like the final straw.
[2025.82s - 2030.78s] Here he's being abused over and over and over,
[2030.78s - 2032.82s] and the fish is a symbol of that.
[2032.82s - 2036.66s] And so here he takes matters into his own hands.
[2036.66s - 2038.30s] I think it is the symbol of that,
[2038.30s - 2041.58s] and it can be the thing that pushes him over the edge.
[2041.58s - 2043.26s] But it's all these other tensions
[2043.26s - 2045.70s] of what's going on with the family.
[2045.70s - 2049.06s] Because they shoot him with arrows, they kill him.
[2049.06s - 2052.70s] But what happens afterwards is also interesting
[2052.70s - 2054.90s] for the dynamics of what was going on before,
[2054.90s - 2058.62s] because we hear nothing from Sotchigo.
[2058.62s - 2061.38s] She and her younger son, Belgetai,
[2061.38s - 2063.86s] they stay with the family, they don't go away.
[2063.94s - 2067.86s] The one who is outraged is Mother Erlun, his mother.
[2067.86s - 2070.02s] She screams and hollers at him
[2070.02s - 2073.94s] in the longest kind of tirade you can imagine
[2073.94s - 2076.66s] about you will never have anybody in your life
[2076.66s - 2078.38s] except your own shadow.
[2078.38s - 2082.82s] And you are worse than everything that she could name.
[2082.82s - 2084.22s] They could be worse than.
[2084.22s - 2087.62s] She was outraged and went on and on and on about it.
[2087.62s - 2092.62s] So she was obviously extremely distressed about it.
[2092.90s - 2095.70s] Whereas Sotchigo, the mother of the boy,
[2095.70s - 2097.26s] she may have been distressed, I don't know,
[2097.26s - 2100.58s] but nothing is shown up in the record.
[2100.58s - 2102.06s] So he does have this episode
[2102.06s - 2104.34s] of having killed off his brother.
[2104.34s - 2107.18s] But I don't think it was a deeply meaningful,
[2107.18s - 2108.58s] I think it was important,
[2108.58s - 2110.86s] but I don't think it was a mostly deeply meaningful
[2110.86s - 2111.98s] for Temujin.
[2113.06s - 2116.10s] The brother was gone, the problem was solved.
[2116.10s - 2119.98s] Mother is extremely ticked off at him, but.
[2120.90s - 2123.86s] But it does show, in fact, it's interesting
[2123.86s - 2125.30s] if it's not a big deal for him,
[2125.30s - 2130.22s] it does show that he's willing to resort to murder
[2130.22s - 2134.38s] to take care of a bad situation.
[2134.38s - 2135.50s] Yes.
[2135.50s - 2139.38s] He is capable of doing anything that needs to be done
[2139.38s - 2142.18s] to resolve what he sees as a problem.
[2142.18s - 2143.98s] Bechter was a problem.
[2143.98s - 2147.58s] He resolved it at a very young age.
[2147.58s - 2150.14s] So he'd had that experience behind him.
[2150.14s - 2153.14s] But now, Bechter's younger brother, Belgetai,
[2153.14s - 2155.22s] is on the raid with him and with Tomoko
[2155.22s - 2158.02s] when they go to capture Burshta back.
[2159.06s - 2163.42s] So he has both loyalty,
[2163.42s - 2167.14s] and Belgetai stays loyal to him his entire life.
[2167.14s - 2168.34s] His entire life.
[2169.30s - 2171.10s] It was very interesting.
[2171.10s - 2173.18s] So actually, if we return to Burshta,
[2173.22s - 2177.78s] is it normal to have such a love story across many years
[2177.78s - 2179.26s] when you're separated,
[2179.26s - 2181.18s] and sort of having that kind of loyalty?
[2181.18s - 2186.06s] Because it was two-way loyalty from Burshta to Temujin,
[2186.06s - 2188.74s] and Temujin to Burshta,
[2188.74s - 2191.90s] and this is like before he was Genghis Khan.
[2191.90s - 2195.54s] I think as children, he was too preoccupied
[2195.54s - 2198.42s] with staying alive and trying to find fish
[2198.42s - 2200.50s] and roots to eat and things like that
[2200.50s - 2203.74s] to really be pining for her all the time.
[2203.74s - 2206.46s] But for whatever reason she came,
[2206.46s - 2211.46s] and it could be that her family liked him in some way,
[2211.94s - 2213.34s] or that she remembered him,
[2213.34s - 2215.70s] or that she had no other suitors,
[2215.70s - 2219.14s] because at 17, she should have been married, actually.
[2219.14s - 2221.62s] So I can't explain why,
[2221.62s - 2224.62s] but it was certainly a strong love story after the fact,
[2224.62s - 2226.02s] if not before.
[2226.02s - 2228.94s] I mean, those two were loyal to each other
[2228.94s - 2230.38s] throughout their lives.
[2231.38s - 2236.38s] I would say the most important person to him after that.
[2236.58s - 2240.66s] He went to literal war to get her back.
[2240.66s - 2241.50s] He risked everything.
[2241.50s - 2243.34s] He was willing to die.
[2243.34s - 2244.42s] He was willing to kill.
[2244.42s - 2248.14s] He was willing to die in order to get her back.
[2248.14s - 2250.26s] And he got her back,
[2251.22s - 2256.22s] and now he's reestablished his relationship with Jamukha.
[2256.38s - 2259.42s] And so they decide to stay together,
[2259.42s - 2262.06s] and they all go off to the Khoronok Valley,
[2263.54s - 2267.30s] and she is pregnant.
[2269.46s - 2272.02s] This becomes a huge issue forever.
[2273.98s - 2276.62s] It's one of those things that to this day, almost,
[2276.62s - 2281.42s] it's an issue in what happens.
[2281.42s - 2284.46s] But as he says much later in life,
[2284.46s - 2286.86s] when his own sons rebel against him,
[2286.86s - 2289.70s] and they call that first child a mercant bastard,
[2291.18s - 2296.18s] he defends his wife viscerously to his own sons.
[2296.70s - 2298.26s] He says, you were not there.
[2298.26s - 2300.86s] You do not know who loved who and who did not.
[2300.86s - 2303.70s] You did not see the sky turning around.
[2303.70s - 2305.26s] You did not see the stars falling.
[2305.26s - 2307.34s] You did not see the earth turn over.
[2307.34s - 2308.94s] You don't know what was happening.
[2308.94s - 2312.22s] And if I say he is my son, he is my son.
[2312.22s - 2314.54s] Who are you to say otherwise?
[2314.54s - 2315.86s] You were not there.
[2315.86s - 2317.98s] You come from the same warm womb.
[2317.98s - 2320.10s] And if your mother could hear your words,
[2320.10s - 2324.98s] her warm womb would turn to cold stone.
[2324.98s - 2327.58s] So he defended her forever.
[2327.58s - 2329.50s] But he's off now.
[2329.50s - 2330.86s] We go back to the beginning.
[2330.86s - 2331.90s] She's pregnant.
[2332.86s - 2335.10s] They're in the Khoronok Valley.
[2335.10s - 2339.34s] And he and Jamukha decide to renew their vows
[2339.34s - 2342.02s] of being anda to each other.
[2343.02s - 2347.94s] So this time, it's more serious and it's a ceremony
[2347.94s - 2352.58s] in front of the whole, we can't say tribe.
[2352.58s - 2354.58s] It's not big enough yet for a tribe,
[2354.58s - 2357.38s] but the whole clan that's there.
[2357.38s - 2361.26s] And then Jamukha takes off a gold belt,
[2361.26s - 2364.14s] which actually he had stolen from the market at some point.
[2364.14s - 2366.38s] And we're on earth, they had a gold belt.
[2366.38s - 2367.22s] I don't know why.
[2367.22s - 2371.46s] He took off a gold belt and he put it on Temujin.
[2372.02s - 2375.62s] And then Temujin gave him a mayor
[2375.62s - 2379.98s] who had never had a fault, had never given birth.
[2379.98s - 2382.22s] And it was an unusual mayor who had a little growth
[2382.22s - 2384.50s] on the front of her head, which they called a horn.
[2384.50s - 2387.02s] So it was an unusual gift and I don't,
[2387.02s - 2390.38s] it has meaning, but I don't know all the meanings behind it.
[2390.38s - 2391.90s] It's sort of odd to me.
[2391.90s - 2393.70s] But the golden belt,
[2393.70s - 2396.30s] I can kind of sort of think about it in different ways.
[2396.30s - 2399.38s] But the gold belt, the belt for the Mongol man
[2399.38s - 2401.30s] is really the sign of manhood.
[2402.18s - 2407.18s] And in fact, this belt, a woman was often then
[2407.18s - 2410.90s] and even now called person without a belt
[2410.90s - 2412.30s] because that's how they were at that time.
[2412.30s - 2414.54s] Today, women wear belts, of course,
[2414.54s - 2419.06s] but they still use the word, buskwi, buskwi, with no belt.
[2419.06s - 2421.46s] So it's a very important symbol of manhood.
[2421.46s - 2425.90s] So he gave that to Temujin and they celebrated.
[2425.90s - 2428.50s] And then the words of the secret history,
[2428.50s - 2430.66s] they slept apart under the same blanket,
[2430.66s - 2435.06s] apart from the other group, and they were happy together.
[2435.06s - 2437.00s] And then when the baby was born,
[2439.38s - 2444.38s] Temujin named the baby Tz'ch, which means visitor.
[2446.14s - 2446.98s] Some people say, well,
[2446.98s - 2450.30s] it's because the child was really the market child.
[2450.30s - 2452.42s] Other people say, no, it's because he was a visitor
[2452.42s - 2455.38s] on the territory of Jamuk at that time.
[2455.38s - 2459.18s] And other people can say, well, but Jamukha's ancestor
[2459.18s - 2462.94s] who had been born from the kidnapped woman who was pregnant,
[2462.94s - 2467.86s] that they had named that Tz'arig'dai, which meant foreigner.
[2467.86s - 2470.82s] So it's kind of like a parallel, the visitor, the foreigner.
[2470.82s - 2474.10s] And so Jamukha's clan took the name from him.
[2474.10s - 2476.26s] They were called Tz'arig'dai.
[2476.26s - 2479.66s] And so there are all these things
[2479.66s - 2482.66s] that sometimes we can't quite understand
[2482.66s - 2485.66s] because we don't have the total mentality of that time
[2485.66s - 2487.54s] and we're not there.
[2487.54s - 2491.18s] But we should say that, I think it's a pretty powerful part
[2491.18s - 2496.18s] of this love story is that the child is likely not his
[2497.42s - 2500.34s] and he accepted that child as his own
[2500.34s - 2503.96s] and defended it as it becomes much more important later
[2503.96s - 2507.24s] as his first child.
[2507.24s - 2511.46s] Yes, he defends his child through his entire life.
[2511.46s - 2515.74s] And, but not long after the birth,
[2517.30s - 2519.66s] he and Jamukha break apart,
[2519.66s - 2522.46s] or really it's Temujin breaks apart
[2522.46s - 2525.62s] at the urging of Ursta.
[2525.62s - 2529.56s] She said, he lords it over you too much.
[2529.56s - 2531.80s] He orders you around too much.
[2531.80s - 2532.90s] You need to be free.
[2532.90s - 2534.54s] We need to break away.
[2534.54s - 2539.10s] And she urged him and he loved his wife more than anything.
[2539.10s - 2540.58s] I think that in a certain way,
[2540.58s - 2543.74s] the most important other character in his life,
[2543.74s - 2546.94s] adult life would be the anda relationship,
[2546.94s - 2551.10s] which gets up being severely tested in the future years.
[2551.10s - 2552.78s] But they run away through the night.
[2552.78s - 2556.40s] They go all night long to escape from him.
[2556.40s - 2559.30s] But he obviously loved birth the most
[2559.30s - 2563.04s] and took the baby of course with them as well.
[2563.04s - 2566.34s] So here's this breaking point of the anda.
[2566.34s - 2568.24s] How did that relationship evolve?
[2568.24s - 2571.16s] The two of them never claimed to break it.
[2572.16s - 2573.70s] They had just separated.
[2574.60s - 2579.20s] And now we have the banghan,
[2579.20s - 2581.28s] the most powerful ruler on the steppe
[2581.28s - 2585.78s] who's ruling out of central Mongolia of the Karyat people.
[2585.78s - 2588.76s] And so Jamukha remains loyal to him,
[2588.76s - 2591.28s] but at first so does Temujin.
[2591.28s - 2592.34s] They're both loyal to him,
[2592.34s - 2596.06s] but they're fighting in different kinds of campaigns and all.
[2596.06s - 2599.32s] So for a while, they're not fighting each other.
[2600.34s - 2602.98s] But eventually some things happened
[2602.98s - 2605.78s] that separate Temujin.
[2605.78s - 2610.78s] Temujin was making all of these great victories for banghan.
[2611.06s - 2613.24s] And he was even got the title bang,
[2613.24s - 2617.50s] which means from Chinese meaning prince or king.
[2619.14s - 2621.74s] A banghan received that from the Jin dynasty
[2621.74s - 2625.46s] because of all of these conquests against the Tatar people.
[2625.46s - 2627.90s] So Temujin was rising up
[2627.90s - 2632.86s] and then he wanted his son to marry the daughter of banghan.
[2632.86s - 2634.52s] And banghan said no.
[2635.50s - 2640.02s] His own son told the father, no, no, no, no.
[2640.02s - 2641.66s] We don't marry those low people.
[2641.66s - 2642.62s] They're Mongols.
[2642.62s - 2644.14s] They're not like us.
[2644.14s - 2646.06s] We are Karyat people.
[2646.06s - 2647.54s] We're not gonna marry them.
[2647.54s - 2652.54s] And so then now war you could say breaks out our feud really.
[2652.54s - 2653.94s] It's more of a feud.
[2653.94s - 2657.50s] And Temujin has to flee far away
[2657.50s - 2660.06s] into the east to a place called Baljuna.
[2660.06s - 2661.14s] And he goes to Baljuna.
[2661.14s - 2665.42s] And at this time, then Jamukha is going to fight
[2665.42s - 2670.06s] on behalf of his Lord banghan.
[2671.22s - 2673.54s] The two of them do not meet in combat,
[2674.40s - 2677.46s] but now their forces are fighting each other.
[2677.46s - 2678.98s] And they didn't see that.
[2680.08s - 2681.82s] I mean, there's an obvious tension there.
[2681.82s - 2686.82s] There's an obvious if slight breaking of loyalty, right?
[2686.86s - 2687.70s] Yes.
[2687.70s - 2689.46s] It's hard to know what's going through their mind
[2689.46s - 2690.30s] at that point.
[2690.30s - 2691.98s] We only have it later on
[2693.46s - 2696.98s] when the relationship is being resolved
[2696.98s - 2699.90s] in unfortunate ways that they claim
[2699.90s - 2702.98s] that neither one of them ever truly broke it
[2702.98s - 2705.98s] because they never harmed each other directly.
[2705.98s - 2710.98s] And in fact, then Temujin eventually defeats banghan.
[2711.18s - 2713.10s] So he takes over central Mongolia.
[2713.10s - 2715.22s] He's starting to really rise up now.
[2715.22s - 2719.40s] And he has the title from his own people of Chinggis Khan.
[2719.40s - 2724.02s] They give him that at Black Heart Mountain by the Blue Lake.
[2724.02s - 2726.34s] It's a very beautiful, special place,
[2726.34s - 2728.58s] but he takes that title.
[2728.58s - 2731.02s] That's not a title that anyone had ever held
[2731.02s - 2731.84s] that we know of.
[2731.84s - 2736.84s] Chinggis Khan, it was a new title that he just thought up
[2738.02s - 2740.46s] or somebody thought up or somebody thought it
[2740.46s - 2742.82s] had auspicious meaning behind it.
[2742.82s - 2746.34s] It's very close to the word Tinggis, which means the sea.
[2746.34s - 2749.26s] It could have had something to do with that.
[2749.26s - 2752.06s] Mongolians really like, we might say puns of,
[2752.06s - 2754.82s] they like words with multiple meanings.
[2754.82s - 2756.10s] And that's very important to them.
[2756.10s - 2757.98s] The more meanings a word has,
[2757.98s - 2760.14s] the more power that word has.
[2760.14s - 2762.66s] So if it has different meaning in different languages.
[2762.66s - 2767.22s] So in Mongolian, it sounds like strong, chin, Chinggis.
[2767.22s - 2769.74s] But in the Turkic, and there are many Turkic people,
[2769.74s - 2773.38s] including the market themselves are mostly Turkic people.
[2773.38s - 2777.30s] It sounds like the sea, Tinggis, Tinggis.
[2777.30s - 2781.26s] So it's exciting to them when there's this double meaning
[2781.26s - 2784.22s] and the double meaning plays with each other
[2784.22s - 2785.14s] and that excites them.
[2785.14s - 2786.94s] Especially with names.
[2786.94s - 2790.34s] I'm like today in Mongolia, well, I've been there so long.
[2790.34s - 2793.14s] I think the fad has passed now, but about 20 years ago,
[2793.14s - 2796.50s] it was popular to name children Michelle girls
[2796.50s - 2799.98s] because it's a French name, an American name,
[2799.98s - 2802.94s] and it means smile in Mongolia.
[2802.94s - 2805.58s] So it's the power of three great languages
[2805.58s - 2806.90s] and three great civilizations.
[2806.90s - 2809.30s] And so many names are like that.
[2809.30s - 2811.46s] And so I think Chinggis, it doesn't have one meaning.
[2811.46s - 2812.78s] I think it means powerful.
[2812.78s - 2813.86s] It means the sea.
[2813.86s - 2815.70s] I think it means many different things.
[2815.70s - 2819.10s] But so he had become a Khan and he was ruling over him.
[2819.10s - 2822.30s] And so Jamukha now switched loyalties
[2822.30s - 2825.30s] to the next kingdom over called the Naiman people
[2825.30s - 2826.90s] who are farther west.
[2826.90s - 2831.90s] And he becomes the protege, I could say,
[2832.90s - 2834.94s] of the Naiman people.
[2834.94s - 2839.94s] But when Chinggis Khan attacks the Naiman,
[2840.70s - 2843.02s] Jamukha deserts the Naiman.
[2843.02s - 2848.02s] He tells them, these people have snouts of steel
[2848.62s - 2850.70s] and they eat humans alive.
[2850.70s - 2853.22s] And he was telling them all these horrible things
[2853.22s - 2855.14s] about the Mongols, you know.
[2855.98s - 2858.98s] And Tayang Khan, the leader of the Naimans,
[2858.98s - 2861.90s] he was rightfully scared about him.
[2861.90s - 2863.82s] And he was left there.
[2863.82s - 2867.82s] And he, in fact, was very quickly also defeated.
[2867.82s - 2872.38s] So Jamukha has not fought against Temujin in this campaign.
[2874.02s - 2876.14s] And he's off with some of his people,
[2876.14s - 2878.74s] Jadugan clan people.
[2878.74s - 2880.46s] He's off with them.
[2880.46s - 2885.46s] And they see the turning of the tide, you know.
[2887.74s - 2891.14s] But he now wants to become the great Khan of the steppe.
[2891.14s - 2893.90s] He has very few followers.
[2893.90s - 2896.22s] But he takes the title Gur Khan,
[2896.22s - 2899.54s] which is a very old, ancient, important title.
[2899.54s - 2904.54s] But because Vang Khan is gone, Torgul Khan gone,
[2905.06s - 2907.14s] that he could take this title
[2907.14s - 2910.42s] and pretend to be the great Khan of the steppe.
[2910.94s - 2914.66s] But his own people turn against him.
[2914.66s - 2916.34s] And they capture him.
[2916.34s - 2919.86s] And they think they will take him to Chinggis Khan.
[2919.86s - 2921.26s] It's not Chinggis Khan.
[2921.26s - 2923.70s] They'll take him and they'll be rewarded,
[2923.70s - 2925.38s] perhaps, for turning him in.
[2926.26s - 2929.14s] And Chinggis Khan does reward them immediately.
[2929.14s - 2931.06s] He kills them all.
[2931.06s - 2936.06s] Because they have betrayed their leader,
[2936.50s - 2938.98s] who is his Anda.
[2939.94s - 2943.70s] It's a very strange encounter.
[2943.70s - 2948.38s] And so, supposedly, Chinggis Khan says to him,
[2948.38s - 2951.94s] come back to me, save me, be beside me,
[2951.94s - 2956.74s] protect me, be my shadow, be my safety guard in life.
[2958.70s - 2961.82s] And supposedly, Jamukha says,
[2963.70s - 2965.62s] but I did betray you.
[2965.62s - 2967.66s] My people fought against you.
[2967.82s - 2969.90s] And you will always know that.
[2969.90s - 2972.38s] And you will never completely trust me.
[2972.38s - 2977.38s] I will be like a louse underneath the collar of your tunic.
[2977.94s - 2982.94s] I will be like a thorn in the lapel of your dell.
[2983.66s - 2988.30s] He said, kill me without shedding my blood.
[2988.30s - 2989.98s] Let me die.
[2989.98s - 2994.98s] And if you do, take my remains up to a high place
[2995.42s - 2999.46s] and bury me, and I will be the guard.
[2999.46s - 3003.18s] I will be the protector for you and your people forever.
[3004.06s - 3009.06s] So, obviously, Jamukha did not participate in the killing,
[3010.86s - 3013.26s] but he ordered the killing.
[3013.26s - 3018.26s] And it's not specified how he was killed
[3018.90s - 3020.38s] without shedding the blood,
[3020.38s - 3021.90s] but the Mongols had several ways.
[3021.90s - 3023.62s] Because the most honorable way to die
[3023.62s - 3025.30s] was without shedding blood.
[3025.30s - 3027.06s] The blood contains part of the soul,
[3027.06s - 3027.90s] and if you lose it,
[3027.90s - 3029.90s] you're losing your soul before you die.
[3029.90s - 3033.90s] So, they usually wrapped them up in felt carpets
[3033.90s - 3035.18s] and then beat them to death
[3035.18s - 3038.10s] or trampled into death with horses, something like that.
[3038.10s - 3039.50s] There are a couple other methods,
[3039.50s - 3041.30s] but I think that's probably the method
[3041.30s - 3043.50s] by which Jamukha was killed.
[3043.50s - 3046.58s] And so, he was killed, and then Tamujin had,
[3046.58s - 3049.66s] or Chinggis Khan had his remains taken up
[3049.66s - 3051.98s] and buried in a high place.
[3052.02s - 3056.58s] This is over near Tuva, which is today part of Russia.
[3056.58s - 3060.54s] But until the 20th century, it was a part of Mongolia,
[3060.54s - 3064.42s] the Tuvan people, very, very close culturally to the Mongols.
[3064.42s - 3069.42s] It seems that both of them, under the under-relationship,
[3070.10s - 3072.58s] had a deep value for loyalty.
[3072.58s - 3074.26s] And so, the way, you know,
[3074.26s - 3077.42s] it's not worth living after you've been disloyal,
[3077.42s - 3081.06s] which is the Jamukha perspective, right?
[3081.10s - 3083.78s] He had become very practical at this point,
[3084.78s - 3089.02s] and he understood that you needed complete total loyalty
[3089.02s - 3091.86s] and trust with everybody around you.
[3093.30s - 3094.78s] And I think for this reason,
[3094.78s - 3099.78s] he was willing either, say, to accept the plea of Jamukha.
[3100.34s - 3104.26s] And when Chinggis Khan was asking him to come back
[3104.26s - 3109.26s] and to be his shadow and to be his safety guard again,
[3111.38s - 3113.58s] maybe that was just a formality
[3113.58s - 3115.18s] that he knew would be rejected.
[3116.22s - 3120.14s] Or maybe when Jamukha offered to be killed
[3120.14s - 3121.34s] without shedding the blood,
[3121.34s - 3123.94s] that was a formality that he thought
[3123.94s - 3125.58s] would not be followed through.
[3125.58s - 3128.90s] Nevertheless, to me, just reading your work
[3128.90s - 3130.54s] and understanding this history,
[3130.54s - 3132.18s] this relationship seems like a really,
[3132.18s - 3134.62s] really important relationship
[3134.62s - 3139.14s] that defines the nature of loyalty for Chinggis.
[3139.14s - 3143.38s] I would say in both negative and positive ways,
[3143.38s - 3145.74s] it was the most important relationship
[3145.74s - 3148.46s] of his adulthood aside from bursa.
[3148.46s - 3150.98s] But that relationship really did not seem
[3150.98s - 3153.34s] to have many negative aspects.
[3153.34s - 3156.30s] They sometimes disagreed on things, but small things.
[3156.30s - 3160.02s] So she was by him and she was positive in every regard
[3160.02s - 3163.70s] so far as we know forever, although she was not submissive,
[3163.70s - 3166.50s] but she was always on his side.
[3166.50s - 3171.50s] And Jamukha, it was just a little too hotheaded for me,
[3171.54s - 3174.34s] I mean, in my evaluation of him,
[3174.34s - 3177.78s] that these things like, oh, we're gonna drop down
[3177.78s - 3180.42s] on the market and we're gonna come through the smoke hole,
[3180.42s - 3181.94s] kill everybody and all.
[3181.94s - 3185.34s] And he had a flair for the dramatic,
[3185.34s - 3188.90s] even in a way giving the gold belt to Mujin.
[3188.90s - 3193.14s] But Jamukha also, he explained himself at the end of life.
[3193.14s - 3198.10s] And he said, you know, we both lost our father,
[3198.10s - 3200.46s] but I also lost my mother
[3200.46s - 3203.26s] and you had a strong mother to raise you.
[3203.26s - 3205.02s] I did not.
[3205.02s - 3207.06s] He said, you had bursa,
[3207.06s - 3210.58s] you have a very strong wife to help you.
[3210.58s - 3214.38s] And my wife, he just used a word like prattler,
[3214.38s - 3218.02s] like she just sort of complains and prattles along
[3218.02s - 3220.78s] and we did not have a relationship.
[3220.78s - 3225.78s] So I think something about that rings true,
[3225.86s - 3229.94s] that there were some elements of that that were true.
[3229.94s - 3233.42s] But Jamukha certainly didn't have the intelligence
[3233.42s - 3237.14s] and the real genius for dealing with people,
[3237.14s - 3238.70s] dealing with soldiers especially,
[3238.70s - 3242.66s] and warfare that Mujin had.
[3242.66s - 3245.42s] Yeah, in that relationship, there's a contrast
[3245.42s - 3249.78s] because Genghis Khan did not accumulate riches
[3249.78s - 3253.06s] or accumulate power in a way
[3253.06s - 3255.02s] that was for the sake of the riches
[3255.02s - 3256.58s] or for the sake of the power.
[3256.58s - 3260.94s] It was always very practical in what is the way
[3260.94s - 3264.70s] to maximize the success of this operation.
[3264.70s - 3267.82s] Yes, yes, he, I often wonder,
[3267.82s - 3269.42s] what happened to the gold belt?
[3269.42s - 3271.98s] It disappeared from the story, you know?
[3271.98s - 3274.98s] And a gold belt doesn't just disappear, you know?
[3274.98s - 3275.94s] What happened to that?
[3275.94s - 3277.86s] It's so interesting because
[3278.74s - 3281.98s] to Mujin was never interested in material goods.
[3281.98s - 3284.46s] And when as Genghis Khan is the ruler,
[3284.46s - 3286.90s] he in some ways you could say became the richest man
[3286.90s - 3289.06s] in the world because he controlled the most wealth
[3289.06s - 3292.22s] flowing through him, but he always dressed simply.
[3292.22s - 3293.94s] He always lived in the tent.
[3293.94s - 3297.54s] And he said, I eat what my soldiers eat.
[3297.54s - 3299.46s] I dress the way my soldiers dress.
[3299.46s - 3301.38s] I live the way my soldiers live.
[3301.38s - 3303.14s] We are the same.
[3303.14s - 3305.34s] So he had no interest in the wealth.
[3305.34s - 3309.82s] And Jamalqa, he had sided before with Wang Han,
[3309.82s - 3312.22s] which was very advantageous because they had more
[3312.22s - 3315.06s] trade goods and wealthier people and all,
[3315.06s - 3319.06s] but he just didn't have the temperament, I think,
[3319.06s - 3323.18s] that was gonna be helpful for Genghis Khan's continued rise.
[3323.18s - 3324.62s] That is one of the powerful things
[3324.62s - 3326.62s] about the Genghis Khan stories.
[3326.62s - 3327.94s] He came from nothing.
[3327.94s - 3329.70s] From absolute nothing.
[3329.70s - 3333.22s] And he didn't, from what I see and understand,
[3333.22s - 3336.42s] become sort of corrupted by the riches or change.
[3336.42s - 3339.98s] He fundamentally remained the same person
[3339.98s - 3342.50s] who does not have value for material things.
[3342.50s - 3345.18s] He changed and matured in various ways over life
[3345.18s - 3347.70s] as we all do or we hope we do,
[3347.70s - 3350.98s] but he never became avaricious in any way.
[3350.98s - 3352.30s] He was never greedy.
[3352.30s - 3353.38s] He was never acquisitive.
[3353.38s - 3355.22s] He kept the simple life.
[3355.22s - 3357.70s] And part of the simple life for him meant
[3357.70s - 3360.34s] that no one was allowed to write about him.
[3360.34s - 3362.66s] No one was allowed to make his likeness.
[3362.70s - 3364.54s] They couldn't paint a picture of him.
[3364.54s - 3367.58s] They couldn't make a statue of him.
[3367.58s - 3369.86s] No building could be built dedicated to him.
[3369.86s - 3373.54s] No palace, no tomb, no temple of any sort.
[3373.54s - 3375.38s] Not even at the point of death,
[3375.38s - 3377.70s] the simplest gravestone.
[3377.70s - 3379.34s] Nothing, nothing.
[3379.34s - 3382.06s] It's fascinating that a kid, like a boy,
[3382.06s - 3383.62s] that doesn't know the world,
[3383.62s - 3386.34s] would have the intelligence to understand
[3386.34s - 3387.58s] how corrupting that is.
[3387.58s - 3390.86s] Like the moment somebody builds a statue of you,
[3390.86s - 3394.30s] it's like a slippery slope towards becoming,
[3394.30s - 3395.90s] not seeing the world clearly,
[3395.90s - 3400.10s] not seeing, surrounding yourself with sick of hands
[3400.10s - 3403.02s] that don't tell you the information,
[3403.02s - 3405.62s] not being able to select the right people
[3405.62s - 3409.30s] to lead the armies or to lead the territories
[3409.30s - 3410.34s] that you conquer.
[3410.34s - 3413.14s] So it's interesting that he had that foresight
[3413.14s - 3417.46s] of don't record, don't worship.
[3417.46s - 3419.38s] That's because that's a dangerous road
[3419.38s - 3420.50s] to go down for a leader.
[3420.50s - 3424.82s] And it's very hard to explain how he stuck to that,
[3424.82s - 3426.02s] how he got it.
[3426.02s - 3428.18s] You're so easily corrupted by power.
[3430.66s - 3435.66s] And yet he maintained this very fierce attitude
[3435.94s - 3439.86s] towards his relationship was with the people around him,
[3439.86s - 3444.30s] his guard mostly, or his private part of the army
[3444.30s - 3446.98s] that went with him, the central part of the army.
[3446.98s - 3448.86s] That was his relationship, his family.
[3448.86s - 3450.62s] He had four wives.
[3450.62s - 3452.98s] This was what was important to him.
[3452.98s - 3456.10s] And in fact, no portrait was painted until 1278.
[3456.10s - 3458.86s] Well, by then he'd already been dead for 51 years.
[3458.86s - 3463.86s] And then no statue until the 21st century.
[3466.14s - 3466.98s] Just incredible.
[3466.98s - 3469.90s] But let's go to the document
[3469.90s - 3472.70s] that you referenced several times, the Secret History.
[3473.66s - 3476.06s] The Secret History is a very unusual document
[3476.30s - 3478.86s] and I happen to love it very much.
[3478.86s - 3481.22s] But I said, Chinggis Khan allowed nothing
[3481.22s - 3484.14s] to be written about him in his lifetime.
[3484.14s - 3485.82s] The people couldn't take notes.
[3485.82s - 3489.18s] Even the army was, he, Chinggis Khan
[3489.18s - 3491.22s] ordered the invention of the alphabet
[3491.22s - 3492.22s] for the Mongol people.
[3492.22s - 3494.86s] And it was adapted from the Uyghur people.
[3494.86s - 3498.50s] And so to this day, it's often called the Uyghur alphabet,
[3498.50s - 3499.90s] the Uyghur alphabet.
[3499.90s - 3502.14s] So he had ordered that and he'd ordered his children
[3502.14s - 3503.50s] to learn to read and write.
[3503.50s - 3507.22s] And some did, I think most did not, but some did.
[3507.22s - 3510.86s] But one of the things he did with every campaign,
[3510.86s - 3515.38s] even the one at the market when he rescued Bertha,
[3515.38s - 3519.74s] was he always adopted one orphan.
[3521.14s - 3524.70s] And that child became a full member
[3524.70s - 3527.06s] of the Mongol nation in his household.
[3527.06s - 3529.70s] His mother, Erlun, would raise the child.
[3529.70s - 3533.66s] So she eventually had a whole household full of boys
[3533.66s - 3536.86s] of different tribes, but they all became
[3536.86s - 3539.94s] very high-ranking members of the government.
[3539.94s - 3542.82s] And one was the Tatar boy who turned out
[3542.82s - 3545.02s] not to be so great as a soldier,
[3545.98s - 3547.98s] but he could read and write.
[3547.98s - 3548.82s] He was the best.
[3548.82s - 3551.90s] And later eventually he became the Supreme Judge,
[3551.90s - 3554.18s] appointed by Chinggis Khan, of course.
[3554.18s - 3556.46s] And so when Chinggis Khan died,
[3556.46s - 3558.38s] he recognized it was important
[3558.38s - 3559.86s] not just to write down the law.
[3559.86s - 3561.94s] That's all Chinggis Khan allowed to be written
[3561.94s - 3563.90s] in blue books, only the law.
[3563.90s - 3567.50s] Nothing about him or campaigns or military, anything.
[3567.50s - 3569.86s] But Shigihutuq was his name.
[3569.86s - 3573.38s] Shigihutuq realized that this was gonna be lost,
[3573.38s - 3576.26s] that this is a great historic thing that has happened.
[3576.26s - 3577.90s] So he compiled the work.
[3577.90s - 3580.02s] Part of it, I don't know, other people contributed,
[3580.02s - 3582.70s] helped him, but it's a little bit unclear.
[3582.70s - 3584.50s] Mongols, they don't specify that.
[3584.50s - 3587.14s] They always tell you exactly where something happens.
[3587.14s - 3590.50s] So we know exactly where it happened in Mongolia.
[3590.50s - 3592.70s] You can still go to that spot where he wrote it.
[3592.70s - 3595.30s] That's very important to the Mongols.
[3595.30s - 3597.14s] And we also know it's the year of the mouse.
[3597.14s - 3601.12s] So it was 1228, Chinggis Khan had died in 27.
[3602.02s - 3604.62s] So he wrote down, it begins with what we would say
[3604.62s - 3607.10s] are the myths.
[3607.10s - 3608.26s] Although I'm not sure they're myths,
[3608.26s - 3609.46s] but the origins of the myths.
[3609.46s - 3612.46s] It begins with the marriage of a gray-blue wolf
[3612.46s - 3614.58s] with a tawny deer.
[3614.58s - 3616.74s] Then some people say, well, that's some kind of myth.
[3617.14s - 3619.38s] It's totemic, and Mongols mostly,
[3619.38s - 3621.54s] they look at me, I asked them about this.
[3621.54s - 3622.56s] They said, what?
[3623.70s - 3628.70s] He was named, blue-gray wolf, she was named tawny deer.
[3628.82s - 3632.30s] They married, you know, very practical about it.
[3632.30s - 3633.50s] And they think they're real people.
[3633.50s - 3635.70s] Maybe they were or not, I don't know.
[3635.70s - 3638.98s] But so this earlier history is just the genealogy
[3638.98s - 3642.22s] as it should be, who knows.
[3642.22s - 3644.62s] But it's also in there because like Bodanchar,
[3644.62s - 3646.14s] they call it Bodanchar the fool.
[3646.18s - 3648.78s] The ancestor of Temujin, he's cast out
[3648.78s - 3650.90s] because he's just so dumb.
[3650.90s - 3652.80s] The rest of the family doesn't want him.
[3652.80s - 3655.62s] And his father is undetermined who he was.
[3655.62s - 3657.90s] He kidnapped the Urihanghai woman.
[3657.90s - 3660.64s] She has the child who becomes the ancestor of Temujin.
[3660.64s - 3662.58s] So it's a confusing mess,
[3662.58s - 3665.34s] but I tend to think it's probably accurate.
[3665.34s - 3666.70s] It has a lot of good information.
[3666.70s - 3669.58s] And by the time you get to the life of Temujin,
[3669.58s - 3671.58s] the reason we know these intimate things
[3671.58s - 3675.14s] is because that person, Shigihuto, he was there,
[3675.14s - 3677.36s] sleeping in the same gear with the people.
[3677.36s - 3680.50s] So we even see in there, he will record instances
[3680.50s - 3684.58s] where Berta sits up in bed and tells her husband,
[3684.58s - 3686.46s] okay, you gotta do this, you gotta do that.
[3686.46s - 3687.66s] You can't do this anymore.
[3687.66s - 3690.54s] We can't think of, you know, it's all recorded, right?
[3690.54s - 3692.62s] So it's a very intimate document.
[3692.62s - 3694.58s] And this is one reason that it was secret.
[3694.58s - 3696.94s] It was only for the family.
[3696.94s - 3699.26s] They were trying to uphold Singshan's prohibition
[3699.26s - 3702.70s] against putting out information about the family.
[3702.70s - 3705.78s] So a secret for a very long time,
[3705.78s - 3710.26s] so much so that scholars began to think it didn't exist.
[3710.26s - 3713.54s] And then in the 19th century, a Russian academic
[3713.54s - 3718.42s] who was working in China at the time in Beijing,
[3718.42s - 3722.78s] he discovered a manuscript which was very, very odd
[3722.78s - 3724.72s] that people didn't think was anything
[3724.72s - 3726.84s] because it's all Chinese characters,
[3728.08s - 3730.86s] but it makes no sense in Chinese.
[3730.86s - 3735.34s] But he recognized, but if you read it, pronounce it,
[3735.34s - 3737.78s] it makes sense in Mongolian.
[3737.78s - 3741.22s] And so it was in this code that had been used
[3741.22s - 3743.88s] to record the information in Chinese.
[3743.88s - 3746.00s] So they're recording the sounds.
[3746.00s - 3747.14s] The sounds, correct.
[3747.14s - 3751.12s] They use Chinese characters to record sounds,
[3751.12s - 3753.78s] which is always problematic in some little areas
[3753.78s - 3756.90s] you're not exactly sure what the name is or something like.
[3756.90s - 3759.92s] But it was a very unusual document.
[3760.98s - 3762.30s] And then once they found it,
[3762.30s - 3765.06s] they realized that some of the Persian documents
[3765.06s - 3767.60s] had incorporated part of that already.
[3767.60s - 3769.22s] So that was very helpful to me
[3769.22s - 3771.42s] because some of the Persians I trust very much
[3771.42s - 3773.98s] and I liked their work very much.
[3773.98s - 3776.76s] And so it was helpful that it already existed
[3776.76s - 3780.90s] and some of it existed in Mongolian,
[3780.90s - 3783.74s] other Mongolian sources that were written later.
[3783.74s - 3786.66s] Some of it was just incorporated.
[3786.66s - 3789.42s] So it seemed to be fairly genuine,
[3789.42s - 3792.10s] but it wasn't 100% pure.
[3792.10s - 3795.52s] It had little things had happened to it along the way.
[3796.78s - 3798.66s] Some things have been stepped here and there
[3798.66s - 3800.30s] and a few words changed.
[3800.30s - 3802.62s] Like sometimes for Temujin, they call him Chinggis Khan.
[3802.62s - 3804.30s] Well, he wasn't the Han then.
[3804.30s - 3806.74s] And sometimes they call him Han, which is like chief.
[3806.74s - 3809.30s] And other times Han, which is emperor.
[3809.30s - 3811.70s] Well, in Mongolian it's a big difference.
[3811.70s - 3813.18s] So there are little things like this
[3813.18s - 3816.02s] that move around that you're not sure why,
[3816.02s - 3819.30s] but it's a document that I have great faith in.
[3819.30s - 3822.50s] It was not published in English until 1982,
[3822.50s - 3825.38s] but Francis Woodman Cleves at Harvard University
[3825.38s - 3827.58s] translated it in the 50s.
[3827.58s - 3829.62s] It was ready for publication
[3829.62s - 3832.06s] and he was having trouble with the publisher.
[3832.06s - 3835.22s] And so it didn't appear for nearly 30 years.
[3835.22s - 3836.78s] It was supposed to be two volumes.
[3836.78s - 3838.66s] The first volume is the translation.
[3838.66s - 3842.50s] The second volume was going to be the notes
[3842.50s - 3844.34s] and the second volume was lost.
[3845.34s - 3849.22s] To this day, it hasn't been found.
[3849.22s - 3852.22s] I would love to see that, but anyway,
[3852.22s - 3854.70s] now it's in all languages, just about in the world.
[3854.70s - 3855.54s] Can you clarify?
[3855.54s - 3857.30s] So there's two volumes.
[3857.30s - 3861.14s] The 19th century Chinese manuscript
[3861.14s - 3863.22s] covers the first volume.
[3863.22s - 3864.94s] Yes, that was translated
[3864.94s - 3867.22s] and then published by Harvard University.
[3867.22s - 3870.10s] But the notes were just the notes from the scholar,
[3870.10s - 3871.74s] Francis Woodman Cleves.
[3871.74s - 3874.14s] Those were his notes, not Mongolian notes.
[3874.58s - 3876.86s] There are Chinese notes that went with it
[3876.86s - 3879.46s] because the Chinese had trouble understanding
[3879.46s - 3881.26s] a lot of things in it.
[3881.26s - 3883.98s] And they also, they disapproved of some things.
[3883.98s - 3886.86s] So they would try to put their own notes in the margins
[3886.86s - 3890.22s] to kind of correct the story and explain a way
[3890.22s - 3895.22s] why the Mongols women would be often marrying their stepson.
[3895.74s - 3900.34s] It just did not match with Confucian ethics.
[3900.34s - 3901.66s] So there are several things like that
[3901.66s - 3903.34s] that they try to skip around.
[3903.34s - 3907.66s] But so it's interesting just to read the Ming dynasty notes
[3907.66s - 3909.06s] that are attached to it.
[3910.18s - 3914.06s] But the document itself, Mongolian Nutsutopcho,
[3914.06s - 3915.66s] it's just so important.
[3915.66s - 3917.70s] And for me, it was the guiding document.
[3917.70s - 3921.14s] I didn't want to be guided by anything else first.
[3921.14s - 3923.10s] Everything else I would check, they're correlated
[3923.10s - 3925.54s] and fill in blanks and give more information.
[3925.54s - 3930.54s] But I went to Mongolia to travel around to those places
[3930.70s - 3933.10s] because they are so exact in there.
[3933.18s - 3934.74s] And to feel it.
[3934.74s - 3937.46s] And it's so important, I think,
[3937.46s - 3940.02s] because history does not live in books.
[3940.02s - 3942.98s] History does not live in archives or even libraries
[3942.98s - 3945.90s] as much as I need them for my work.
[3945.90s - 3948.10s] But history lives in the people.
[3948.10s - 3951.38s] History lives in the memory of the people and the culture.
[3951.38s - 3955.42s] And for example, the episode with the kidnapping of Berchtek.
[3955.42s - 3959.26s] So I went to that place and I didn't know when it happened,
[3959.26s - 3960.90s] what season it happened.
[3960.90s - 3963.06s] It was very important for figuring out the births
[3963.06s - 3965.42s] that came afterwards and other events
[3965.42s - 3966.70s] that were being correlated.
[3966.70s - 3967.74s] Very important to me.
[3967.74s - 3970.46s] And so I'm just talking to the people who live
[3970.46s - 3972.62s] in that valley, the nomads there.
[3972.62s - 3975.26s] They said, oh, it's clear.
[3975.26s - 3976.62s] It was the winter.
[3976.62s - 3979.14s] I said, oh, where did you read that?
[3979.14s - 3981.62s] Said, no, Granny Kwakson was on the ground
[3981.62s - 3983.34s] and she could feel the vibrations.
[3983.34s - 3986.10s] She said, look, this is summertime now.
[3986.10s - 3987.46s] You're not gonna feel any vibrations.
[3987.46s - 3989.06s] The ground here is so soft.
[3990.06s - 3993.90s] Suddenly, a whole important piece that I've been searching
[3993.90s - 3998.90s] for just came together from some nomad sitting there
[4000.18s - 4005.18s] next to his horse and he was absolutely right.
[4005.86s - 4007.58s] It could only happen in the winter.
[4007.58s - 4009.74s] And that also correlates with the time
[4009.74s - 4010.98s] that reading was done.
[4010.98s - 4013.06s] So it correlates with other historic factors.
[4013.06s - 4015.46s] But then that gave me the time basis
[4015.46s - 4017.30s] for figuring out a lot of other things.
[4017.98s - 4019.90s] History lives in the people.
[4019.90s - 4024.90s] Just to link on that point, you visited different places
[4025.18s - 4028.22s] that were important to the story of Genghis Khan.
[4028.22s - 4030.02s] What did it feel like?
[4030.02s - 4032.34s] What are some memorable things about
[4034.06s - 4036.46s] just the experience of standing there?
[4038.06s - 4040.18s] I really set out mostly to visit the cities
[4040.18s - 4043.46s] he had conquered across Central Asia and all.
[4043.46s - 4044.86s] There was so little to learn.
[4044.86s - 4046.46s] I mean, everything was kind of known
[4046.46s - 4048.74s] of whatever the chroniclers had recorded.
[4048.74s - 4051.98s] The archeologists had found whatever they had found.
[4051.98s - 4054.78s] And I get there and he hadn't spent much time there.
[4054.78s - 4056.38s] He didn't identify with it.
[4056.38s - 4057.46s] I wasn't feeling anything.
[4057.46s - 4061.18s] But in Mongolia, I would go to these places
[4061.18s - 4063.78s] and I would know if Genghis Khan came back today,
[4063.78s - 4065.98s] he would know exactly where he is.
[4065.98s - 4067.10s] There's no road.
[4067.10s - 4067.94s] There's no sign.
[4067.94s - 4069.46s] There's no building.
[4069.46s - 4072.58s] There's no power line going.
[4072.58s - 4073.42s] Nothing.
[4073.82s - 4078.02s] Just to smell the air, to feel it, to see the animals
[4078.02s - 4080.18s] and to see what kind of animals live here,
[4080.18s - 4082.62s] what kind of plants are growing here,
[4082.62s - 4086.30s] you begin to get a feeling for how he was thinking.
[4086.30s - 4088.02s] And then you begin to see,
[4088.02s - 4090.42s] ah, I know which direction they came from.
[4090.42s - 4092.82s] The only direction they could come from was that way.
[4092.82s - 4094.26s] You begin to see it.
[4094.26s - 4099.26s] And his life starts to unfold in a very dramatic way
[4099.70s - 4101.06s] that I have the text,
[4101.90s - 4105.70s] but the text is like it has no scenery, no props,
[4105.70s - 4106.54s] nothing like that.
[4106.54s - 4108.42s] The Mongols all understand their way of life.
[4108.42s - 4110.74s] They don't need to explain anything.
[4110.74s - 4113.38s] They know which way the gear faces with the sun.
[4113.38s - 4114.86s] They know all these things.
[4114.86s - 4116.78s] But for me, that's how I learned it.
[4116.78s - 4119.02s] It was from being with the people.
[4119.02s - 4121.54s] It was the most important thing.
[4121.54s - 4124.90s] And this was starting in the 1990s.
[4124.90s - 4129.90s] And the people, at this time, they were amazed
[4129.90s - 4131.82s] that I would come.
[4131.82s - 4133.70s] The Soviet era had just ended.
[4133.70s - 4135.86s] Socialism was just ending.
[4135.86s - 4137.62s] Democracy was starting.
[4137.62s - 4140.54s] And Chinggis Khan had been forbidden to them
[4140.54s - 4142.58s] for almost the entire century.
[4142.58s - 4145.06s] And every known descendant of Chinggis Khan
[4145.06s - 4146.94s] was killed in Mongolia.
[4148.18s - 4149.78s] Following the secret history,
[4149.78s - 4153.06s] that became the key to writing what I wrote.
[4153.06s - 4155.78s] Take the history, which is difficult to understand.
[4155.78s - 4159.50s] You have to go over and I often never understand
[4159.50s - 4162.18s] the different parts or I change my mind
[4162.18s - 4163.98s] and think it was yes, now it's no.
[4165.14s - 4168.26s] But the secret history is a valuable document.
[4168.26s - 4171.22s] And to me, also, it's the opening document
[4171.22s - 4174.26s] of Mongolian written language.
[4174.26s - 4176.10s] And I think it's very important
[4176.10s - 4180.50s] how do people begin their written language.
[4181.58s - 4184.58s] And they begin it with the words deri thinges,
[4185.42s - 4189.74s] deri thinges, from highest heaven,
[4189.74s - 4193.34s] came the destiny of the blue wolf
[4193.34s - 4197.34s] who was married to the tawny deer and their descendants
[4197.34s - 4199.30s] who came from the great sea
[4199.30s - 4201.86s] to live at the base of Mount Burhan Haldun.
[4203.26s - 4207.54s] And then integrating the spiritual elements of nature,
[4207.54s - 4208.94s] the mountains and the great sea
[4208.94s - 4213.06s] and this kind of, just like a deep connection to nature
[4213.06s - 4213.90s] that they have.
[4214.94s - 4218.14s] Mongolia is a world that, for the most part,
[4218.14s - 4220.86s] is the same as when Chinggis Khan was there.
[4220.86s - 4223.90s] We cannot say that far to any other place in the world.
[4225.30s - 4227.06s] I mean, certainly not for America,
[4227.06s - 4228.86s] but just a few hundred years ago,
[4228.86s - 4231.02s] it was entirely different.
[4231.02s - 4232.90s] People, languages, everything.
[4232.90s - 4235.46s] But you can't say it for London or Moscow
[4235.46s - 4239.06s] or Istanbul, Constantinople,
[4239.06s - 4241.14s] all of these things have changed so much.
[4241.14s - 4243.54s] But Mongolia is still Mongolia.
[4243.54s - 4247.62s] It's one of the largest countries in the world in space
[4247.62s - 4252.10s] with the fewest number of people, about today 3.3 million.
[4252.10s - 4255.74s] And they're spread out and they live in their environment
[4255.74s - 4257.42s] in such an intimate way.
[4258.78s - 4261.50s] This was important for learning about Chinggis Khan,
[4261.50s - 4265.58s] how he thought, how he hunted, how he strategized for war.
[4265.58s - 4267.30s] You learn that from the people today
[4267.30s - 4270.82s] because they are still there, they're still living.
[4270.82s - 4274.06s] What's the open Mongolian step like?
[4274.06s - 4278.66s] As we return to the feeling of Timogen and Chinggis Khan,
[4278.66s - 4280.42s] what's it like looking at this place
[4280.42s - 4282.86s] that has not changed since his time?
[4282.86s - 4284.46s] The first thing I think about this step
[4284.46s - 4289.42s] is that you can see forever in every direction.
[4289.42s - 4293.74s] There's no building, nothing to stop your line of view.
[4293.74s - 4297.42s] And it's like being in the ocean in many ways.
[4297.42s - 4299.50s] So you have this extremely open space
[4299.50s - 4302.06s] and the wind is usually blowing through it.
[4302.06s - 4303.78s] But it's extremely fresh.
[4303.78s - 4306.62s] It's coming out of Siberia, it's coming out of the Arctic.
[4306.62s - 4309.38s] It sweeps down across Mongolia.
[4309.38s - 4312.98s] Cold is the dick sometimes, but it's always fresh,
[4312.98s - 4314.18s] always fresh.
[4314.18s - 4316.94s] So you have the wind coming in,
[4316.94s - 4319.26s] you have the smell of the wind,
[4319.26s - 4322.58s] but also then there's grass.
[4322.58s - 4325.14s] The smell of grass becomes very important.
[4325.18s - 4329.54s] Now, because of the particular location,
[4329.54s - 4330.74s] from one year to another,
[4330.74s - 4332.34s] one area may have grass one year
[4332.34s - 4335.38s] and then drought the next year, another area has grass.
[4335.38s - 4338.90s] So you don't always know, if it's not grass, it's dust.
[4338.90s - 4341.74s] You have dust flowing in, the dust doesn't smell so good,
[4341.74s - 4343.66s] it doesn't feel so good.
[4343.66s - 4346.94s] But that's just one more part of the country.
[4348.46s - 4350.74s] The waters are mostly pure.
[4350.74s - 4353.50s] Now, unfortunately, there has been pollution
[4353.78s - 4358.34s] in this century from mining in several areas.
[4358.34s - 4361.22s] But even when I was there,
[4361.22s - 4363.94s] even today, when we go to some place like the Selang River,
[4363.94s - 4365.98s] where we talk about the market lift.
[4365.98s - 4369.30s] So it's a place of pure waters.
[4369.30s - 4372.94s] And that's how Mongolians define their world,
[4372.94s - 4374.62s] is by the water.
[4374.62s - 4378.34s] They don't, Chinggis Khan does not give lands
[4378.34s - 4380.58s] to his sons to rule.
[4380.62s - 4384.46s] He gives waters and people to rule.
[4384.46s - 4386.58s] They do not refer to the earth as land,
[4386.58s - 4391.58s] they refer to the earth as Dalai, ocean, the sea.
[4391.62s - 4393.94s] And so water is very important.
[4393.94s - 4397.78s] And to learn the rules about water,
[4397.78s - 4399.62s] you don't camp by water.
[4399.62s - 4401.38s] If you camp by water, your animals
[4401.38s - 4403.86s] and you are gonna be polluting it, messing it up.
[4403.86s - 4406.10s] So they're back, maybe in our modern terms,
[4406.10s - 4407.66s] about a kilometer back.
[4407.66s - 4410.82s] You take the animals to the river to drink
[4410.82s - 4412.62s] and then you take them away.
[4412.62s - 4414.86s] You do not bathe in that river.
[4414.86s - 4417.46s] You take the water away from the river
[4417.46s - 4419.22s] and you bathe away from the river.
[4419.22s - 4421.58s] So you do not pollute the river.
[4421.58s - 4424.30s] The rules are very strict and very clear.
[4424.30s - 4426.86s] And they're from the time of Chinggis Khan
[4426.86s - 4428.30s] about how to deal with.
[4428.30s - 4430.66s] Well, also it's dangerous to live close to the river
[4430.66s - 4432.62s] because there are flash floods in the summertime.
[4432.62s - 4435.42s] You could suddenly have it and it could wipe away
[4435.42s - 4437.78s] if your camp is right there by the water.
[4439.06s - 4442.62s] So the people, they live with nature in a way
[4442.62s - 4444.98s] that I don't see anywhere else in the world.
[4446.02s - 4449.54s] And even today with the changes with the cell phone
[4449.54s - 4452.50s] and with solar panels and they could get TV
[4452.50s - 4454.58s] out in the middle of the step,
[4454.58s - 4457.10s] still they're living a similar life.
[4457.10s - 4460.06s] The young people of course wanna drive a motorbike
[4460.06s - 4463.22s] but they're still herding cows and yaks and camels.
[4463.22s - 4465.06s] If it's on a motorbike, okay.
[4465.06s - 4467.18s] They're still doing it the Mongol way.
[4468.30s - 4473.30s] But then if we go to the time of Timogen, of Chinggis Khan,
[4474.42s - 4477.18s] another component is the horses.
[4477.18s - 4479.98s] Can we talk about their relationship with the horse?
[4479.98s - 4483.46s] Thinking about this open step from a young age,
[4483.46s - 4486.46s] they've been, all Mongols are trained
[4487.46s - 4491.90s] to master riding horses as you write,
[4491.90s - 4493.66s] while standing on the horse.
[4493.66s - 4497.18s] So they learned how to ride while standing on the horse
[4497.18s - 4498.30s] from a young age.
[4498.30s - 4499.34s] While standing on the horse,
[4499.34s - 4501.74s] they often jousted with one another
[4501.74s - 4504.26s] to see who could knock the other off.
[4504.26s - 4507.42s] When their legs grew long enough to reach the stirrups,
[4508.30s - 4510.30s] they were also taught to shoot arrows
[4510.30s - 4512.46s] and to lasso on horseback,
[4512.46s - 4514.46s] making targets out of leather pouches
[4514.46s - 4516.94s] that they would dangle from poles
[4516.94s - 4518.94s] so that they would blow in the wind.
[4518.94s - 4521.34s] The youngsters practice hitting the targets from horseback
[4521.34s - 4523.22s] at varying distances and speeds.
[4523.26s - 4526.10s] The skills of such play proved invaluable
[4526.10s - 4528.78s] to horsemanship later in life.
[4528.78s - 4532.82s] Can you speak to the relationship of Chinggis Khan
[4532.82s - 4534.74s] and the Mongols to horses?
[4536.02s - 4538.78s] The Mongol and the horse are inseparable.
[4538.78s - 4541.66s] I wrote one line in a book that the editor removed
[4541.66s - 4543.22s] because that was insulting.
[4543.22s - 4545.26s] I said, the Mongol and the horse, they live together,
[4545.26s - 4547.58s] they know each other with every twitch of the muscle
[4547.58s - 4549.50s] and they smell the same.
[4549.50s - 4553.14s] Well, I was saying it just not to be insulting
[4553.14s - 4556.50s] about anything, but they have that deep intimacy
[4556.50s - 4559.50s] and the horses do know their owner from the smell.
[4559.50s - 4560.46s] This is very important.
[4560.46s - 4562.14s] It's also important for Chinggis Khan
[4562.14s - 4565.58s] because they made the flags, what they call the sult,
[4565.58s - 4569.78s] out of the horse hair from their own horses.
[4569.78s - 4573.30s] And so in battle, they used it for a very practical purpose
[4573.30s - 4577.98s] and that is the horses would return to their source
[4577.98s - 4581.06s] because they knew the smell of their flag
[4581.10s - 4583.66s] with other members of their own herd.
[4583.66s - 4587.70s] So the language itself, I have never ever mastered
[4587.70s - 4590.90s] all the words just for the colors of horses,
[4590.90s - 4593.22s] much less for all the other things about it.
[4593.22s - 4596.42s] I can remember Mongolians being out there
[4596.42s - 4599.50s] in the countryside and they say, oh, I want to learn English.
[4599.50s - 4601.30s] I say, okay, yeah, that's nice.
[4601.30s - 4603.38s] You teach me some words in Mongolian,
[4603.38s - 4604.62s] I teach you the words, okay.
[4604.62s - 4606.14s] They say, what color is that horse?
[4606.14s - 4607.70s] I say, brown.
[4607.70s - 4609.46s] They would say, brown.
[4609.46s - 4610.30s] I say, yes.
[4610.30s - 4612.18s] Okay, what color is that horse?
[4612.18s - 4613.02s] Brown.
[4613.02s - 4616.14s] Then they say, but you said this color was brown.
[4616.14s - 4617.30s] What color is this?
[4617.30s - 4618.14s] Yeah.
[4622.14s - 4623.22s] It's just amazing.
[4623.22s - 4625.54s] I mean, they have words based on sort of
[4625.54s - 4628.14s] how smooth the coloring is and the variation
[4628.14s - 4630.78s] in the texture and all the different.
[4630.78s - 4632.78s] Today in English, sometimes you can put them together.
[4632.78s - 4636.82s] We say like yellow brown or brown brown or black, you know.
[4636.82s - 4641.02s] But the words for horses by, of course, by sex
[4641.02s - 4643.30s] and then they'd have three because they have geldings.
[4643.30s - 4644.94s] And so they're very important too.
[4644.94s - 4647.94s] And by age and by whether or not they've reproduced
[4647.94s - 4649.34s] in the case of the females,
[4649.34s - 4652.66s] all these things are important parts of the horse.
[4652.66s - 4655.62s] And the horse, a few years ago,
[4655.62s - 4659.30s] a presidential candidate ran under the slogan,
[4659.30s - 4663.22s] raised in the dust of many fast horses.
[4663.22s - 4665.98s] It just resonates with the Mongolian spirit
[4666.02s - 4668.46s] and the dust itself is important.
[4668.46s - 4671.18s] The Mongolians, they will wipe the sweat
[4671.18s - 4673.26s] and the dust off the horse
[4673.26s - 4675.30s] and wipe it onto their own forehead,
[4675.30s - 4677.82s] which is the most sacred part of the body
[4677.82s - 4679.86s] where the soul resides.
[4679.86s - 4684.26s] This is how intimate a relationship is with the horses.
[4684.26s - 4687.10s] And they're hard on them in some ways.
[4687.10s - 4688.70s] They train them very well.
[4688.70s - 4690.62s] They ride them very hard,
[4690.62s - 4694.46s] but the horses are also trained for that.
[4694.46s - 4696.30s] They use a very small crop.
[4697.50s - 4699.66s] It's a little bit like a stick with a slight whip
[4699.66s - 4702.30s] at the end of the day, hit the rump of the horse.
[4702.30s - 4703.50s] Never anything else.
[4703.50s - 4705.38s] They're horrified at Western people
[4705.38s - 4709.62s] who use metal spurs and metal
[4710.70s - 4712.90s] to harm the horse in the stomach.
[4712.90s - 4715.62s] And to harm the head of a horse,
[4715.62s - 4717.06s] they say it's a capital crime.
[4717.06s - 4719.54s] I mean, I don't know anyone who's ever executed for it,
[4719.54s - 4722.98s] but you never ever harm a horse's head.
[4722.98s - 4726.74s] So horses are important in every way,
[4726.74s - 4728.22s] even religiously important
[4728.22s - 4731.62s] with the making of the fermented horse's milk
[4731.62s - 4734.78s] that the mother goes out every morning
[4734.78s - 4737.98s] and she throws some to each of the four directions
[4737.98s - 4739.34s] to start the day.
[4739.34s - 4743.06s] And they use it for every kind of thing.
[4743.06s - 4744.74s] But you know, some things puzzled me
[4744.74s - 4747.10s] that in my watching,
[4747.10s - 4749.42s] I remember one day being with a very nice family.
[4749.42s - 4751.10s] It happened to be on a gelding day
[4751.10s - 4755.18s] when they were out there gelding the would-be stallions
[4755.18s - 4756.42s] who don't get to be stallions.
[4756.42s - 4760.78s] But this family, they had a bunch of boys
[4760.78s - 4762.90s] and only together about one or two girls
[4762.90s - 4764.34s] were like four or five boys.
[4764.34s - 4766.94s] And one boy was maybe 11 years old.
[4766.94s - 4768.30s] He fell from the horse.
[4768.30s - 4769.86s] You could see it, not so far away.
[4769.86s - 4771.30s] He fell from the horse.
[4771.30s - 4772.94s] He didn't get up.
[4772.94s - 4773.86s] No one moved.
[4774.70s - 4777.46s] In fact, they all kind of turned attention away.
[4777.46s - 4780.18s] And I thought, what am I supposed to say?
[4780.18s - 4781.06s] This boy fell down.
[4781.06s - 4782.94s] Somebody go get him.
[4782.94s - 4783.78s] No.
[4784.62s - 4787.42s] And then the boy was trying to hobble back.
[4787.42s - 4789.50s] He still had the reins to his horse,
[4789.50s - 4790.86s] but he couldn't remount.
[4790.86s - 4792.22s] And he was trying to hobble back.
[4792.22s - 4795.26s] So his little brother went out to help him come in
[4795.26s - 4798.10s] and they came into the gear and they sat down.
[4798.10s - 4799.98s] The mother just turned her back.
[4799.98s - 4802.58s] And I'm thinking, how on earth can you do this?
[4802.58s - 4803.42s] This is a child.
[4803.42s - 4804.34s] This is your child.
[4806.02s - 4808.42s] But two weeks later, by chance,
[4809.26s - 4811.82s] another boy who is practicing for Nadam,
[4811.82s - 4815.50s] the annual races like this boy had been doing,
[4815.50s - 4817.34s] he was off in an area right close
[4817.34s - 4819.14s] to the forested mountain area.
[4819.14s - 4822.42s] And the horse bolted, took off through the woods.
[4822.42s - 4824.18s] He was knocked off by a tree.
[4824.18s - 4825.98s] And then the horse went deeper into the woods.
[4825.98s - 4826.90s] The boy followed him.
[4826.90s - 4828.94s] The boy became lost.
[4828.94s - 4830.90s] The boy was 12 years old.
[4830.90s - 4835.06s] He was lost for two weeks and he lived.
[4835.06s - 4837.18s] I would have died in 48 hours.
[4837.18s - 4838.02s] He lived.
[4838.02s - 4839.94s] Well, he slept in the daytime when it was warm.
[4839.94s - 4841.86s] He walked at night when it was cold,
[4841.86s - 4843.30s] even though this was the summertime,
[4843.30s - 4846.10s] the nights can be quite cold, especially on a mountain.
[4846.10s - 4850.34s] And he sang loudly all night long to keep the wolves away.
[4850.34s - 4851.98s] And he knew what to eat.
[4851.98s - 4854.18s] And then he walked until he found water moving
[4854.18s - 4857.26s] and then he would follow that water down to the neck.
[4857.26s - 4858.70s] He lived.
[4858.70s - 4861.74s] And I realized the boy falls from the horse,
[4861.74s - 4863.42s] his mother's not gonna be there.
[4864.54s - 4865.82s] She knows that.
[4865.86s - 4868.14s] And it's probably hard for her too,
[4868.14s - 4871.38s] to see her boy suffer, but she knows.
[4873.02s - 4875.62s] Just a small tangent.
[4875.62s - 4878.02s] There's a wrestler named Kerry Kolat.
[4878.02s - 4882.38s] And he tells the story about mental toughness,
[4882.38s - 4887.38s] that the first time he saw truly mentally tough people
[4888.02s - 4891.82s] was when he visited Mongolia for a wrestling tournament.
[4891.82s - 4894.34s] And he remembered that they were taking showers
[4894.34s - 4896.30s] in ice cold water.
[4896.30s - 4899.62s] And all the other wrestlers, they would take the shower
[4899.62s - 4900.90s] and when the water hits them,
[4900.90s - 4902.98s] you could see a little grimace.
[4902.98s - 4907.50s] With the Mongols, it was emotionless.
[4907.50s - 4912.50s] Sort of like ice cold water or any other kind of hardship.
[4913.98s - 4916.94s] You build a hardness to that.
[4916.94s - 4919.38s] And I suppose that falling from the horse
[4919.38s - 4920.62s] is just an example of that.
[4920.62s - 4923.34s] There's a mental hardness and a mental toughness.
[4923.34s - 4926.50s] You have to be able to take care of yourself.
[4926.50s - 4928.46s] And with the weather, for example,
[4928.46s - 4930.62s] often in that time is still today,
[4930.62s - 4933.38s] some people, if they can have the privacy to do it,
[4934.58s - 4936.82s] the men will strip naked in the first heavy snow
[4936.82s - 4938.78s] and roll around in the snow
[4938.78s - 4941.74s] in order to prepare for the coming winter.
[4943.06s - 4945.34s] And the valley where I live,
[4945.34s - 4947.58s] the rest of the wrestlers come there to train
[4947.58s - 4949.66s] in the summertime for the competition.
[4950.42s - 4953.90s] And the water is very cold coming down from the mountain.
[4953.90s - 4957.30s] And every day when there's a break, they go down,
[4957.30s - 4960.02s] they take, again, they do not get in the water, never,
[4960.02s - 4961.30s] but they take the water
[4961.30s - 4964.30s] and they pour the cold water over themselves.
[4964.30s - 4968.98s] And yes, that's refreshing to them, refreshing.
[4968.98s - 4971.38s] Well, then getting back to the horses,
[4971.38s - 4973.66s] the value they had for the horses
[4973.66s - 4975.14s] and the horse riding skill
[4975.14s - 4977.22s] they developed throughout their life
[4977.22s - 4979.54s] created one of the most unstoppable
[4979.54s - 4981.50s] military forces in history.
[4981.50s - 4984.50s] So if we just talk about the mounted archery
[4984.50s - 4986.46s] that they've employed in war,
[4987.70s - 4992.70s] the Mongols were able to do targeted shooting accurately
[4993.30s - 4997.10s] at 200 meters or more while riding fast,
[4998.34s - 5002.02s] up to speeds of 60 kilometers an hour, I read.
[5002.02s - 5005.34s] So there's a lot to say,
[5005.34s - 5008.86s] you have to time and just watching some of the videos,
[5008.86s - 5011.86s] just incredible how stable you can be on top of a horse.
[5011.86s - 5014.18s] And I guess you're supposed to be shooting
[5014.18s - 5015.42s] at a moment of the gallop
[5015.42s - 5019.30s] when all four of the feet of the horse are off the ground.
[5019.30s - 5021.30s] And so you have to time all of that.
[5021.30s - 5023.78s] You have to position your body to maintain balance.
[5023.78s - 5026.14s] And then there's the skill of the actual holding
[5026.14s - 5027.98s] and shooting the bow accurately.
[5027.98s - 5030.18s] And there's obviously the technology of the bow,
[5030.18s - 5032.50s] the composite bow, the recurve bow.
[5032.50s - 5035.30s] They've also, I read, used crossbows later.
[5036.26s - 5037.26s] They've adapted the technology.
[5037.26s - 5039.66s] And there's a particular kind of thumb draw
[5039.66s - 5043.22s] that you use for shooting with the composite bow
[5043.22s - 5044.94s] that works for a horse,
[5044.94s - 5047.86s] because the thing is bouncing up and down, right?
[5047.86s - 5050.42s] So you have to not drop the arrow.
[5050.42s - 5052.46s] It's just incredible to be able to shoot
[5052.46s - 5054.98s] while the horse is going 60 kilometers an hour.
[5054.98s - 5059.18s] Anyway, can you speak to this kind of exceptional excellence
[5059.18s - 5062.18s] that the Genghis Khan and the Mongols had
[5062.18s - 5067.18s] for riding horses and engaging in war off of the horse?
[5071.26s - 5075.74s] The Mongol, the horse and the bow were a perfect combination.
[5075.74s - 5079.70s] And it was the most lethal weapon known to the world
[5079.70s - 5081.50s] before the modern era.
[5081.50s - 5084.02s] It was incredible, the synchronization
[5084.02s - 5086.30s] and the timing of the movements.
[5086.30s - 5088.54s] And also the years of skill,
[5088.54s - 5091.90s] the fact that from absolute birth,
[5091.90s - 5093.98s] the Mongols would be on a horse.
[5093.98s - 5095.50s] And by three years old,
[5095.50s - 5098.70s] they would probably be riding alone on the horse.
[5098.70s - 5101.94s] Now, when I first went to Mongolia in the 1990s,
[5101.94s - 5106.66s] at that time, all jockeys on horses for races
[5106.66s - 5108.50s] had to be under six years old.
[5110.02s - 5111.10s] That was the age limit.
[5111.10s - 5114.22s] The cutoff was six years old at that time.
[5114.22s - 5117.78s] And so you had some as three years old racing out there.
[5117.78s - 5118.90s] It's absolutely incredible.
[5118.90s - 5121.78s] Of course, at that age, they can't even have a saddle,
[5122.62s - 5123.66s] because they can't even be used.
[5123.66s - 5125.86s] So all they're doing is staying on the horse.
[5125.86s - 5128.06s] The horse has been trained to do what it has to do
[5128.06s - 5129.18s] and they just stay on it.
[5129.18s - 5131.58s] But by staying on it, they learn the horse,
[5131.58s - 5133.18s] they become one.
[5133.18s - 5135.54s] And not just one horse with one rider,
[5135.54s - 5137.82s] but one rider with several horses.
[5137.82s - 5140.98s] They usually, five is the number that you should have
[5140.98s - 5142.74s] for you when you go off to battle.
[5142.74s - 5145.02s] And this ability, they didn't shoot.
[5145.02s - 5146.54s] You have to defend your animals.
[5146.54s - 5148.06s] There are wolves around,
[5148.06s - 5149.06s] there are foxes and other things.
[5149.06s - 5150.86s] And in some areas, there were even tigers.
[5150.86s - 5154.86s] And other animals that would come in.
[5154.86s - 5156.58s] And you had to be able to shoot to defend it
[5156.58s - 5158.94s] against other people who might be raiding you.
[5159.86s - 5163.18s] So they became excellent archers.
[5163.18s - 5166.82s] They had composite bows that were very powerful,
[5166.82s - 5171.06s] much more powerful than those of most sedentary people.
[5171.06s - 5174.02s] Now I say all that because it's very important,
[5174.02s - 5178.62s] but those are all sort of nomadic traits
[5178.70s - 5181.18s] of the great steppe anyway.
[5181.18s - 5182.66s] I mean, in an earlier version,
[5182.66s - 5185.14s] you had the Huns who came out of Mongolia.
[5185.14s - 5188.14s] And Hun is just the Mongolian word for human.
[5188.14s - 5189.82s] Hun, that's to this day,
[5189.82s - 5191.90s] that's what they say for a human being.
[5191.90s - 5193.66s] So they came out of Mongolia.
[5193.66s - 5197.62s] And all the early Turkic groups came out of Mongolia.
[5197.62s - 5200.10s] And they had the similar skills.
[5200.10s - 5202.98s] So you have this perfect weapon,
[5202.98s - 5206.22s] but also you have to have perfect strategy
[5206.26s - 5210.70s] and how to coordinate it and organize it and use it.
[5210.70s - 5214.22s] And this is where the genius that I cannot explain at all,
[5214.22s - 5217.26s] but the genius of Cengiz Han came in.
[5217.26s - 5220.66s] Other people I think had been very good in earlier times,
[5220.66s - 5223.94s] a number of Turkic leaders and also,
[5223.94s - 5225.50s] or even Attila the Han,
[5225.50s - 5228.26s] who of course was actually born in the West,
[5228.26s - 5232.66s] but they were charismatic leaders and very dramatic leaders.
[5232.66s - 5234.74s] And it wasn't that they were so excellent
[5234.74s - 5236.86s] in their strategy.
[5236.86s - 5238.66s] They were very good in warfare.
[5238.66s - 5240.30s] And that's what carried him through.
[5240.30s - 5242.86s] Cengiz Han's army was extremely good in warfare,
[5242.86s - 5244.66s] but small.
[5244.66s - 5248.06s] He never got probably above 100,000,
[5248.06s - 5250.42s] at the most 110,000.
[5250.42s - 5251.94s] That is small.
[5251.94s - 5253.78s] When you're going against China
[5255.26s - 5257.98s] that has millions just in the army,
[5258.94s - 5259.98s] not to count in the country,
[5259.98s - 5261.98s] and you're going against Russia,
[5261.98s - 5263.66s] and you're going against the Middle East
[5263.66s - 5266.78s] and Persia and Afghanistan and these areas,
[5268.06s - 5270.94s] your whole army has to be as finely tuned
[5270.94s - 5274.58s] as each rider, each bow and each horse.
[5274.58s - 5275.78s] That's the weapon,
[5275.78s - 5279.42s] what the army becomes the super weapon of Cengiz Han,
[5279.42s - 5282.30s] how he organized it and how he used it
[5282.30s - 5284.78s] and the strategies that he put together.
[5284.78s - 5288.70s] Yeah, when you have a small army, just think about that.
[5288.70s - 5293.26s] A small army that conquered the world.
[5293.26s - 5296.30s] It would fit in a stadium today in America.
[5298.38s - 5303.22s] So there's extreme efficient coordination of units,
[5303.22s - 5304.66s] mostly cavalry, right?
[5304.66s - 5305.50s] All cavalry.
[5305.50s - 5306.34s] It's all cavalry.
[5306.34s - 5310.46s] He had no infantry and he had no baggage train,
[5310.46s - 5313.02s] he had no backup commissary,
[5314.30s - 5315.94s] early on no engineer corps,
[5315.94s - 5318.74s] later one was added much later,
[5318.74s - 5320.62s] but no, all cavalry.
[5320.62s - 5323.58s] And so there's light cavalry and heavy cavalry
[5323.58s - 5327.58s] and breaking down units using the decimal system,
[5327.58s - 5329.78s] 10, 100, 1000.
[5329.78s - 5333.82s] So there's a kind of hierarchy
[5333.82s - 5337.66s] where you delegate authority,
[5337.66s - 5341.14s] but to the degree there's commands,
[5341.14s - 5343.90s] they must be followed strictly.
[5343.90s - 5347.22s] So for like extremely efficient, accurate,
[5347.22s - 5352.22s] precise deployment of these troops in the battlefield
[5353.02s - 5355.26s] and the dynamic movement of the troops,
[5355.26s - 5358.58s] including all the interesting tactics that were utilized,
[5358.58s - 5361.42s] you have to have really good communication and coordination.
[5361.42s - 5363.58s] And for that orders must be followed.
[5363.58s - 5364.42s] Yes.
[5365.42s - 5366.78s] Is there something to speak to that?
[5366.78s - 5369.02s] Like how do you tune this kind of system
[5369.02s - 5371.70s] to where everybody is working together so well?
[5371.70s - 5374.34s] I think the first point is the extreme loyalty
[5374.34s - 5377.10s] of the people whom Cengiz Han chose.
[5377.94s - 5380.38s] His kinsmen, as we said, had deserted him.
[5380.38s - 5384.22s] His anda was a questionable relationship,
[5384.22s - 5388.38s] but all the others that he found were just common people,
[5388.38s - 5390.30s] herders or hunters, very common,
[5390.30s - 5391.82s] and they were loyal to him
[5391.82s - 5395.82s] and never ever revolted against him, never betrayed him.
[5395.82s - 5397.66s] So he had extreme loyalty.
[5397.66s - 5400.82s] And then as you mentioned, he organized his decimal system.
[5400.82s - 5404.78s] So the smallest unit of the army was the arft,
[5405.74s - 5408.34s] the squad of 10 men.
[5408.34s - 5410.54s] They were put together and then the head of that squad,
[5410.54s - 5412.66s] he had total control over it,
[5412.66s - 5416.06s] but the men knew that they were going to protect each other
[5416.06s - 5421.06s] and they had to come back with every member or everybody.
[5421.38s - 5423.58s] You don't leave anybody behind.
[5423.58s - 5425.54s] So this was extremely important.
[5425.54s - 5429.34s] So if you submit to the orders of the man in charge,
[5429.34s - 5433.62s] you know that he's risking his own life for you also.
[5433.66s - 5435.42s] And you know that your brother on the left
[5435.42s - 5438.58s] and on the right is risking his life for you.
[5438.58s - 5443.02s] The army was organized with five horses, each man.
[5443.02s - 5445.54s] They had their bow and they had a lot of arrows,
[5445.54s - 5446.50s] as many as they could have,
[5446.50s - 5450.70s] but they also retrieved arrows at the end of their battle.
[5450.70s - 5453.38s] And they also would retrieve the enemy arrows.
[5453.38s - 5455.22s] This was a great advantage, by the way,
[5455.22s - 5456.50s] when they hit Russia,
[5456.50s - 5459.50s] because the Russians could not use Mongolian arrows.
[5459.50s - 5462.38s] They could knock them in their bow,
[5462.38s - 5464.42s] but the Mongols could use Russian arrows.
[5464.42s - 5467.42s] But so all these little things,
[5467.42s - 5469.34s] but it's not even just the arrow.
[5469.34s - 5473.02s] Also, they had to carry needle and thread.
[5474.22s - 5477.10s] Every soldier had to be able to sew.
[5477.10s - 5479.98s] And sometimes that could be a torn garment.
[5479.98s - 5483.78s] It could be a piece of skin or a wound that somebody has.
[5483.78s - 5485.54s] It was a very odd thing when you think about
[5485.54s - 5487.06s] the army of Chinggis Khan
[5487.06s - 5488.78s] and they're carrying everything themselves.
[5488.78s - 5490.86s] They don't have any pack train behind them.
[5490.86s - 5492.62s] And that one of the things they have to carry
[5492.62s - 5495.98s] is needle and thread in order to sew up things.
[5495.98s - 5498.30s] So complete self-reliance in that regard.
[5498.30s - 5502.02s] Yes, they also carried dried dairy products,
[5502.02s - 5505.22s] adult, it's called, with a dry curd.
[5505.22s - 5507.70s] And they can keep it for a couple of years even.
[5507.70s - 5509.74s] But you dry it and then when you need it,
[5509.74s - 5512.38s] you can put it in a flask of water.
[5512.38s - 5515.42s] You ride all day, it juggles up and down, boom, boom, boom,
[5515.42s - 5518.30s] and turns into kind of thick protein.
[5518.30s - 5521.02s] It said that the Mongols could easily go three to five days
[5521.02s - 5523.38s] without ever building a fire.
[5523.38s - 5524.82s] They had enough food there with.
[5524.82s - 5526.98s] So all these little things at the lowest level
[5526.98s - 5531.14s] were important, as well at the highest level of his loyalty,
[5531.14s - 5534.22s] of his men to him, and it went all the way down.
[5534.22s - 5536.22s] Loyalty was extremely important.
[5536.22s - 5540.34s] And he organized the army into left wing, right wing,
[5540.34s - 5541.34s] or east and west.
[5541.34s - 5544.82s] Mongols, the word for left is east,
[5544.82s - 5547.62s] the word for right is west.
[5547.62s - 5548.94s] So those two wings.
[5548.94s - 5551.66s] And then in the middle was the goal, the center,
[5551.66s - 5556.66s] this moving center that was his bodyguard
[5556.66s - 5558.26s] and his unit in the middle.
[5559.30s - 5562.54s] Then you see they'd have a vanguard and a rear guard.
[5562.54s - 5565.38s] Sometimes the vanguard would go out as much as two years
[5565.38s - 5568.30s] in advance to clear the land, run the people away,
[5568.30s - 5572.10s] scare them, make them go away so that the grass is left there
[5572.10s - 5574.54s] for the army when it moves through.
[5574.54s - 5577.26s] And they never marched the way other armies do
[5577.26s - 5580.58s] in a line of one following the other
[5580.58s - 5583.86s] that would always go in long lines spread out in wings
[5584.74s - 5589.10s] so that each horse is on its own path, you could say,
[5589.10s - 5591.10s] but all parallel together.
[5591.10s - 5595.06s] So they had very precise ways of doing things.
[5595.06s - 5599.50s] And this, I think, was the secret with him.
[5599.50s - 5604.50s] And he used the best people, but he also,
[5605.30s - 5608.30s] he was willing to train them as much as possible.
[5608.30s - 5611.70s] He never punished them for what happened.
[5611.70s - 5614.74s] So Shikihutu, for example, the supreme judge,
[5614.74s - 5617.42s] he was command one time of a group in the battle
[5617.42s - 5620.58s] in Afghanistan and he lost the battle,
[5620.58s - 5623.62s] which is very, very unusual for Mongols.
[5623.62s - 5626.58s] So Chinggis Khan went out with him, said,
[5626.58s - 5629.18s] okay, let's go to the battlefield together
[5629.18s - 5630.46s] and look it over.
[5630.46s - 5633.02s] And you explained to me what you did,
[5633.06s - 5635.18s] and then we will talk about it.
[5635.18s - 5637.30s] So he was very thoughtful in the way
[5637.30s - 5639.42s] that he was training the people around him.
[5639.42s - 5640.78s] And they knew they weren't gonna be punished.
[5640.78s - 5642.90s] It's not like these countries where the general comes back
[5642.90s - 5645.02s] and gets executed because he lost.
[5645.02s - 5646.82s] No, Chinggis Khan knows every general
[5646.82s - 5650.38s] is gonna try 100% and if they retreat, fine.
[5650.38s - 5651.98s] They're saving Mongol lives.
[5651.98s - 5652.94s] They know what to do.
[5652.94s - 5654.50s] He respects that.
[5654.50s - 5658.14s] So all these things like that fit together.
[5658.14s - 5661.18s] But I think a part of it that was important for him,
[5662.18s - 5664.82s] so he had this base from step warfare already,
[5664.82s - 5669.82s] the horse, the archery and how that all fit together.
[5669.82s - 5674.74s] But he was very quick to embrace any kind
[5674.74s - 5677.90s] of other technology that he saw.
[5677.90s - 5682.14s] I think that sedentary armies, like sedentary civilizations,
[5682.14s - 5684.02s] they get stuck in their ways.
[5684.02s - 5685.78s] This is how we do it.
[5685.78s - 5687.58s] And we're gonna make it a little faster,
[5687.58s - 5689.62s] we're gonna make it a little bigger, a little stronger,
[5689.66s - 5691.62s] but this is how we think.
[5691.62s - 5694.38s] Chinggis Khan had no set way to think.
[5694.38s - 5698.30s] And when he encountered the first walled cities around 1209,
[5698.30s - 5701.02s] after founding his nation in 1206,
[5701.02s - 5702.82s] he went out on these raids.
[5702.82s - 5705.62s] And I really think they were raids, not wars at first.
[5705.62s - 5707.94s] So he went into Tangut territory
[5707.94s - 5710.22s] of what's now Northwestern China
[5710.22s - 5712.10s] in the upper reaches of the Yellow River.
[5712.10s - 5713.34s] So he went there and of course,
[5713.34s - 5715.22s] the cities have walls around them.
[5715.22s - 5718.70s] This is a man who's never encountered a wall in his life.
[5718.74s - 5720.82s] Well, he did, but they were made out of felt.
[5720.82s - 5723.34s] The walls around his tent are, you know, felt walls.
[5723.34s - 5725.42s] Yeah, just imagine what it's like
[5726.78s - 5729.42s] for the first time in your life seeing a wall.
[5729.42s - 5730.26s] Yes.
[5730.26s - 5732.34s] When you come from the Mongolian steppe,
[5732.34s - 5736.98s] where there's very few even natural wall-like things.
[5736.98s - 5738.02s] Right.
[5738.02s - 5740.18s] Well, they have like the wall cliffs in some places,
[5740.18s - 5742.10s] they're familiar with that and they could climb them,
[5742.10s - 5743.98s] but they don't have people at the top
[5743.98s - 5745.38s] shooting down the mountain.
[5745.38s - 5746.62s] But on the...
[5746.62s - 5748.90s] So he looked, but he looked at everything around him
[5748.90s - 5751.18s] and he saw, okay, they have this river
[5751.18s - 5752.50s] and they have all these channels
[5752.50s - 5754.86s] and they're always moving water around.
[5754.86s - 5757.42s] And like we said, for a Mongol,
[5757.42s - 5760.10s] anything that moves is a potential weapon.
[5760.10s - 5762.98s] Anything that doesn't move is a target.
[5762.98s - 5764.18s] You've got moving water,
[5764.18s - 5767.54s] you've got a standing non-moving wall.
[5767.54s - 5772.54s] So he said, okay, the men are gonna dig a channel
[5773.66s - 5775.18s] and they're gonna bring down the wall
[5775.18s - 5776.94s] of the Tangut city.
[5776.94s - 5778.26s] Well, they did it.
[5778.26s - 5780.58s] And they didn't know exactly what they were doing
[5780.58s - 5783.06s] and the embankments weren't high enough
[5783.06s - 5785.86s] and too much water came in from the Yellow River
[5785.86s - 5788.06s] and actually flooded out the Mongol camp.
[5788.94s - 5790.66s] But okay, it happened.
[5790.66s - 5792.22s] We learned that lesson.
[5792.22s - 5793.62s] So we're gonna prove it.
[5793.62s - 5796.06s] And that became a strategy that actually worked
[5796.06s - 5800.34s] for the Mongols for the next 50 years,
[5800.34s - 5801.70s] all the way to Baghdad.
[5801.70s - 5803.62s] They were able to use it when they conquered Baghdad
[5803.62s - 5805.10s] in 1258.
[5806.06s - 5810.78s] So this ability to see things and to try them.
[5810.78s - 5813.38s] And if they fail to try them in a different way,
[5813.38s - 5814.22s] but a better way,
[5814.22s - 5816.46s] we all think we learned from our mistakes.
[5816.46s - 5819.42s] We all, yeah, yeah, I learned from that.
[5819.42s - 5820.46s] And what do we do?
[5820.46s - 5822.22s] We repeat the mistake.
[5822.22s - 5824.14s] I think it's just a part of human nature.
[5824.14s - 5826.02s] Well, it didn't work the first eight times,
[5826.02s - 5827.38s] but I'm gonna do it one more time.
[5827.38s - 5828.86s] I think it's gonna work.
[5828.86s - 5831.14s] I know I'm gonna win the lottery this time
[5831.14s - 5832.62s] because I got the right.
[5832.62s - 5834.38s] That's how we think.
[5834.38s - 5838.54s] But he had that real ability to first of all,
[5838.54s - 5840.82s] to be humble before these other things
[5840.82s - 5842.86s] he didn't know about technology
[5842.86s - 5845.38s] and to understand that he didn't understand,
[5845.38s - 5849.22s] but he could understand it in his own way.
[5849.22s - 5850.06s] And he did.
[5850.06s - 5852.42s] Over and over the Mongols were excellent
[5852.42s - 5855.22s] at putting together new things in new ways
[5855.22s - 5857.82s] and using them against their enemies.
[5857.82s - 5862.26s] So rapid extreme continued innovation.
[5862.26s - 5864.02s] So you couple that with a,
[5865.90s - 5869.26s] I mean, you have to say a revolutionary idea
[5869.26s - 5874.26s] that promotion should be based on merit.
[5874.26s - 5877.90s] That idea combined with the innovative approach
[5877.90s - 5882.90s] to the military, it just feeds on itself
[5882.98s - 5885.26s] because the people who are learning from their mistakes
[5885.26s - 5888.22s] and constantly improving are the ones that get promoted
[5888.22s - 5889.38s] in the positions of power,
[5889.38s - 5891.90s] and then they inspire everybody else to do the same.
[5891.90s - 5894.86s] And so it's just, if every action is judged
[5894.86s - 5897.62s] based on the excellence of that action,
[5897.62s - 5901.50s] then over time, repeated iteration in war
[5901.50s - 5905.26s] creates a more and more powerful army.
[5905.26s - 5907.30s] Yes, yes.
[5907.30s - 5910.78s] And they were able to do that for three generations
[5910.78s - 5914.02s] to create an army that was ever expanding,
[5914.02s - 5917.46s] ever changing its tactics and its technology.
[5917.46s - 5920.54s] And they got worse at it over time.
[5921.38s - 5923.94s] But Chinggis Han was the one who innovated it.
[5923.94s - 5925.10s] He was the best with it.
[5925.10s - 5928.34s] And he used to throughout his lifetime,
[5928.34s - 5930.98s] and he was getting better over his lifetime
[5930.98s - 5933.18s] with using foreign information,
[5933.18s - 5935.66s] foreign technology, foreign ideas.
[5937.70s - 5939.50s] He just had a genius for that.
[5941.22s - 5942.70s] If we can go back to the horses,
[5942.70s - 5945.22s] you mentioned every soldier had five horses.
[5945.22s - 5947.38s] The reason for that is the horses get tired.
[5947.38s - 5948.22s] Yes.
[5948.22s - 5951.90s] And so you can cover a lot of ground in a single day.
[5951.90s - 5952.74s] Yes.
[5952.74s - 5955.22s] Usually the way the rotation of the horses would,
[5955.22s - 5957.38s] the horse would usually ride for one day
[5957.38s - 5960.38s] and then rest for the next four to five days.
[5960.38s - 5963.22s] And then another horse would be riding the next day.
[5963.22s - 5965.06s] One way to measure it is that later,
[5965.06s - 5967.46s] at the time of the death of a good day Han,
[5967.46s - 5972.46s] the word went from Mongolia to Hungary in six weeks.
[5973.62s - 5975.70s] Mongolia to Hungary in six weeks.
[5975.70s - 5977.26s] So let's just imagine this army
[5977.26s - 5980.94s] that's able to move at such high speeds
[5980.94s - 5983.46s] does not need to follow roads
[5983.46s - 5986.30s] because it's used to riding in the open step.
[5986.30s - 5990.26s] So you can do all kinds of dynamic movements
[5990.26s - 5991.90s] in encircling a place.
[5992.78s - 5995.38s] And then also one of the other famous things
[5995.38s - 5998.50s] is the feigned retreat that was used continuously.
[5998.50s - 6000.30s] Can you explain how that worked?
[6000.30s - 6004.30s] The Mongols did not fight for honor
[6004.30s - 6007.74s] the way we often think of brave soldiers,
[6007.74s - 6010.98s] Achilles and the Iliad and things like that.
[6010.98s - 6012.70s] They fought for victory.
[6012.70s - 6013.98s] That was the one thing.
[6013.98s - 6017.38s] So to retreat, to save lives and all,
[6017.38s - 6019.14s] there's no shame in that.
[6019.14s - 6021.62s] So the Mongols would often retreat
[6021.62s - 6023.54s] and Chinggis Khan basically,
[6023.54s - 6026.26s] he himself never fought a battle
[6027.26s - 6029.54s] that he thought he could lose.
[6029.54s - 6031.74s] And he won every battle he fought.
[6031.74s - 6033.78s] That wasn't true for every general under him.
[6033.78s - 6035.74s] As we said for Shigi Hutu, for example,
[6035.74s - 6039.02s] but he won every battle because there was no shame
[6039.02s - 6042.14s] in retreating and in not fighting, not engaging the enemy.
[6042.14s - 6045.06s] However, that also becomes a tactic
[6045.06s - 6047.14s] and that they would send in a small group
[6047.14s - 6048.82s] of soldiers to attack.
[6048.82s - 6051.34s] And the Mongols were able to fire, of course,
[6051.34s - 6053.66s] going forward on the horse.
[6053.66s - 6058.66s] They were able to then act like they were defeated
[6059.10s - 6063.10s] and turn, but they could still fire backwards,
[6063.10s - 6065.78s] which was the Parthian shot, which is unusual in the world,
[6065.78s - 6069.14s] not totally unique, but unusual to fire backwards.
[6069.14s - 6071.26s] But the Mongols also could lean down
[6071.26s - 6072.94s] and fire under the neck of the horse.
[6072.94s - 6075.62s] So they're protected and they had many different ways.
[6075.62s - 6078.38s] So they're firing coming, they're firing going,
[6078.38s - 6081.66s] but usually the soldiers who were against them
[6081.66s - 6083.86s] would break ranks to chase them.
[6083.86s - 6085.58s] They want to go, they want to get their weapons,
[6085.58s - 6087.22s] they want to kill the Mongols.
[6087.22s - 6089.42s] And if they didn't immediately break ranks,
[6089.42s - 6092.54s] the Mongols would often start throwing things out
[6092.54s - 6095.62s] like loot from someplace and valuables around.
[6095.62s - 6098.58s] And the soldiers usually couldn't resist it.
[6098.58s - 6101.46s] So they'd come chasing out after the Mongols,
[6101.46s - 6104.90s] sort of pale male going in every different direction.
[6104.90s - 6107.34s] And then they would get to a certain point
[6107.34s - 6110.30s] and from behind the two hills,
[6110.30s - 6113.10s] the Mongol army would come and slaughter them.
[6114.06s - 6116.90s] Over and over this tactic worked.
[6116.90s - 6118.06s] It's like the one with the water.
[6118.06s - 6121.38s] I'm thinking to people, how can they not know
[6121.38s - 6122.82s] this is what the Mongols are doing?
[6122.82s - 6124.50s] How can they not know that?
[6124.50s - 6126.46s] Human nature, there's something that
[6126.46s - 6128.54s] when the forces are retreating.
[6128.54s - 6130.50s] You want to follow them, you want to run after them.
[6130.50s - 6131.66s] You can't help it.
[6131.66s - 6132.48s] Yeah, yeah.
[6132.48s - 6133.32s] I don't know what that is.
[6133.32s - 6135.22s] That's maybe the animalistic,
[6135.22s - 6139.74s] but take that with the ability at high speeds
[6139.74s - 6144.10s] for the Mongols to encircle and attack the flanks,
[6144.10s - 6149.10s] which there has been many great military historians
[6149.78s - 6153.86s] who have written about the great military forces
[6153.86s - 6155.06s] throughout history.
[6155.06s - 6158.90s] And one of the things you write about in general
[6158.90s - 6163.34s] is the Mongols don't get written about almost at all
[6163.34s - 6168.22s] and don't get credit for the military tactics
[6168.22s - 6170.96s] and the military genius exhibited
[6170.96s - 6172.70s] through the different strategies.
[6172.70s - 6174.98s] This kind of idea of the feign retreat
[6174.98s - 6177.02s] and then attacking the flanks,
[6177.02s - 6182.02s] that's been, if not invented and perfected by Genghis.
[6183.98s - 6185.86s] He really was a military genius.
[6185.86s - 6187.38s] But there were other things too.
[6187.38s - 6189.58s] They didn't like roads.
[6189.58s - 6191.22s] They just didn't like the roads.
[6191.22s - 6193.42s] So they would often be coming from some direction
[6193.42s - 6195.30s] that nobody ever came from.
[6195.30s - 6198.02s] And the people would be unprepared for that.
[6198.02s - 6201.42s] The most famous example is probably in Bukhara.
[6201.42s - 6203.70s] This is a beautiful, wonderful old city,
[6203.70s - 6206.74s] a great place in the world to this day.
[6207.18s - 6209.14s] They came across the desert.
[6210.94s - 6212.86s] Well, nobody had ever attacked across the desert.
[6212.86s - 6214.54s] So people see dust coming.
[6214.54s - 6215.94s] They think, oh, a caravan.
[6215.94s - 6217.90s] They don't even know what's going on.
[6217.90s - 6220.90s] But it was the direction that was a surprise element
[6220.90s - 6222.78s] in that particular case.
[6222.78s - 6224.42s] So he was able to think in ways
[6224.42s - 6226.86s] that the other people were not thinking yet
[6226.86s - 6228.86s] and to be able to surprise them.
[6228.86s - 6231.30s] What do you think it, again, felt like
[6231.30s - 6235.22s] to have this Mongol armada, the horses,
[6236.06s - 6237.78s] it must have, the ground must shake
[6237.78s - 6239.82s] when you have that many horses.
[6239.82s - 6242.62s] What do you think it feels like to be in a town
[6242.62s - 6245.62s] when Genghis Khan is approaching?
[6245.62s - 6249.34s] I think the terror was one of the greatest weapons
[6249.34s - 6251.10s] that he had.
[6251.10s - 6255.50s] That he cultivated this reputation of ferocity.
[6255.50s - 6257.50s] Not only did he win battles,
[6257.50s - 6260.78s] but he didn't allow people to write about him, as we said,
[6260.78s - 6263.54s] but he encouraged refugees.
[6263.54s - 6264.62s] And when he conquered a city,
[6264.62s - 6266.98s] he always made sure there were plenty of refugees
[6266.98s - 6268.06s] to go to the next city,
[6268.06s - 6269.42s] because it's going to weaken them.
[6269.42s - 6271.86s] It's going to weaken their food supply.
[6271.86s - 6273.66s] And they're going to terrorize the people
[6273.66s - 6275.62s] with tales of the millions of people
[6275.62s - 6278.90s] that the Mongols killed with their steel chiseled teeth
[6278.90s - 6282.02s] and eating children and all kinds of horrible tales.
[6282.02s - 6284.02s] Genghis Khan encouraged it.
[6284.02s - 6285.74s] You know, this is propaganda.
[6285.74s - 6289.82s] It's terrorism of a mental sort to weaken the enemy.
[6289.82s - 6291.54s] And so when you hear,
[6292.38s - 6293.58s] or even if you know they're coming,
[6293.58s - 6296.78s] you see the dust, you hear the kind of roar
[6296.78s - 6298.74s] that comes with all those horses
[6298.74s - 6300.42s] and the trembling of the earth,
[6300.42s - 6302.94s] it must have been truly terrifying.
[6302.94s - 6304.90s] So the psychological warfare
[6304.90s - 6307.38s] was a part of the whole process.
[6307.38s - 6311.02s] But as I understand, there was always an offer
[6311.02s - 6314.38s] for the towns and the territories being attacked
[6314.38s - 6318.42s] for them to surrender peacefully without the loss of life.
[6318.42s - 6319.26s] Yes.
[6319.26s - 6324.26s] And the alternative would be the near complete loss of life.
[6324.34s - 6325.94s] Can you speak to that?
[6325.94s - 6329.18s] Genghis Khan had a precise system, exactly.
[6329.18s - 6332.18s] He sent in envoys first to explain to the people
[6332.18s - 6333.86s] a little bit about the Mongols.
[6333.86s - 6335.78s] Already much was known.
[6335.78s - 6338.78s] But to explain to them that if they surrendered,
[6338.78s - 6340.94s] all the lives would be spared
[6340.94s - 6343.94s] and they could continue in their professions.
[6343.94s - 6346.26s] It's just that now the rulers would be the Mongols.
[6346.26s - 6347.78s] They would have to pay the taxes
[6347.78s - 6350.10s] and usually it'd be the same taxes they'd paid before,
[6350.10s - 6352.14s] but now they would go to the Mongols.
[6352.14s - 6353.90s] That was kind of the general system.
[6353.90s - 6356.30s] And because you only have a hundred thousand soldiers,
[6356.30s - 6359.02s] you can't leave a detachment there.
[6359.02s - 6361.66s] So you're gonna leave the local people in charge
[6361.66s - 6365.02s] to run their country or their city or their area
[6365.02s - 6367.34s] the way they have done in the past.
[6367.34s - 6370.02s] He was absolutely faithful to that.
[6370.02s - 6373.82s] In one episode in the north of Persia, modern Iran,
[6373.82s - 6377.78s] his son-in-law, Tokhtar, he violated that
[6377.78s - 6378.90s] and was stealing and looting
[6378.90s - 6380.66s] for the people who had surrendered.
[6381.90s - 6386.54s] Genghis Khan called him in and he stripped him of his rank
[6386.54s - 6391.54s] and he said, the next city, you go first as a common soldier.
[6392.78s - 6394.94s] And of course he was killed in the next battle.
[6394.94s - 6396.98s] I don't know the name of the daughter, unfortunately.
[6396.98s - 6398.22s] I've tried to figure that out.
[6398.22s - 6400.90s] But anyway, it was a close relative to him
[6400.90s - 6403.82s] and he was killed in the next by violating this law.
[6403.82s - 6405.50s] So that was the law.
[6405.50s - 6409.58s] So then if the city fought and the Mongols won,
[6409.58s - 6411.02s] they did not kill everyone.
[6411.02s - 6414.14s] What they did was they killed all the leaders.
[6414.14s - 6416.74s] They felt like the elite had not served them well.
[6416.74s - 6418.62s] And they usually killed the army
[6418.62s - 6421.38s] because they couldn't incorporate the army into their own.
[6421.38s - 6422.62s] The army had failed.
[6423.50s - 6426.90s] But the one thing that they valued were all the artisans,
[6426.90s - 6428.58s] everybody who had a skill.
[6428.62s - 6431.02s] And that skill could be making a pot.
[6431.02s - 6433.70s] It could be hammering out a metal plate.
[6433.70s - 6435.86s] It can be weaving carpets.
[6435.86s - 6438.94s] It can be translating or just reading and writing.
[6438.94s - 6441.50s] Every person with a skill was spared.
[6443.02s - 6445.90s] So the killing of the people who were defeated
[6445.90s - 6447.78s] wasn't so severe.
[6447.78s - 6450.62s] What was truly severe was if you surrendered.
[6451.50s - 6452.58s] And many of them did.
[6452.58s - 6454.66s] And then they knew they would not be harmed.
[6454.66s - 6455.50s] So they're not harmed.
[6455.50s - 6456.34s] The Mongols go on.
[6456.34s - 6458.58s] The Mongols are hundreds of miles away.
[6458.58s - 6460.94s] And all of a sudden, forget about the Mongols.
[6460.94s - 6462.74s] Genghis Khan said word that we're supposed to send
[6462.74s - 6464.78s] so many cows or sheep to help.
[6464.78s - 6466.14s] Forget about the Mongols.
[6466.14s - 6467.30s] They're far away.
[6467.30s - 6468.46s] It's a removal.
[6468.46s - 6470.70s] No, he stopped.
[6470.70s - 6472.38s] He returned.
[6472.38s - 6475.94s] He conquered the city and he killed everyone.
[6475.94s - 6477.22s] That's the way it worked.
[6477.22s - 6481.14s] So the most drastic slaughter happens
[6481.14s - 6484.26s] when there's an agreement and then betrayal.
[6484.26s - 6485.10s] Yes.
[6485.74s - 6488.14s] As it turned out, I would say it was more the Middle East
[6488.14s - 6491.70s] or what we call around Iran and Afghanistan
[6491.70s - 6494.22s] where these were the worst cases.
[6494.22s - 6498.70s] And I would say only in Afghanistan
[6498.70s - 6501.30s] did sometimes the emotion of the slaughter
[6503.10s - 6505.10s] take over in an unfortunate way.
[6505.10s - 6509.26s] But he had a grandson whom he loved very much.
[6509.26s - 6511.22s] And that grandson traveled with him.
[6511.22s - 6513.70s] And he had the happy childhood
[6513.70s - 6516.14s] that Temujin had not had.
[6516.14s - 6519.34s] And I think Genghis Khan just loved that about him.
[6519.34s - 6521.70s] But in Afghanistan, he was sent off
[6521.70s - 6524.50s] to conquer the Valley of Bamiyan
[6524.50s - 6526.82s] where the great Buddhas are actually.
[6526.82s - 6531.82s] He was sent to Bamiyan and as it says in the Persian history,
[6532.46s - 6537.46s] the thumb of fate fired the arrow that shot him down.
[6540.14s - 6541.18s] He was killed.
[6541.98s - 6546.98s] And for Genghis Khan, he had never lost a family member.
[6547.58s - 6551.14s] Not one, none of his sons, none of his grandsons in battle.
[6551.14s - 6552.54s] He had not lost them.
[6552.54s - 6556.14s] And now to lose the most valuable grandson you have,
[6556.14s - 6560.14s] the one that's your pride and joy in so many ways.
[6560.14s - 6563.54s] And so he called the father, his own son to him
[6564.90s - 6568.70s] and did not tell him, he did not announce it to the public.
[6568.70s - 6571.30s] And the son came and the son didn't know
[6571.30s - 6572.42s] why he was being summoned.
[6572.42s - 6574.18s] And Genghis Khan said,
[6576.18s - 6581.18s] you have to tell me that you will not cry or moan
[6583.50s - 6588.18s] when I tell you this, but your son is no more.
[6590.54s - 6593.62s] And the father was, no one was allowed to moan.
[6593.62s - 6595.46s] No one was allowed to cry.
[6595.46s - 6597.78s] No one was allowed to do anything.
[6597.82s - 6602.82s] You just, he said, make them cry.
[6604.42s - 6608.18s] You know, he came down on the people of Afghanistan
[6609.86s - 6613.90s] so harshly and it went on for weeks and weeks,
[6613.90s - 6616.74s] the killing in Afghanistan.
[6616.74s - 6620.06s] And then it just kind of wore itself out.
[6620.06s - 6623.46s] He recognized that he had allowed his emotions
[6623.46s - 6625.54s] to overcome practicality
[6625.54s - 6628.94s] and that slaughtering of these people should stop.
[6628.94s - 6629.78s] And so he did.
[6629.78s - 6631.42s] But that's the only time I know of
[6631.42s - 6635.86s] that he really kind of lost control of his own emotions.
[6635.86s - 6638.22s] And it's something we can all understand,
[6638.22s - 6641.78s] but his response was truly extreme of,
[6641.78s - 6644.42s] we will not cry, we will not mourn.
[6644.42s - 6647.22s] They will cry, they will mourn.
[6647.22s - 6652.22s] So that goes against the cold rational way
[6653.22s - 6658.22s] he approached war, which is peace is offered
[6659.70s - 6661.66s] and then betrayal is punished.
[6661.66s - 6663.66s] I should add, he did not slaughter the people
[6663.66s - 6665.14s] in the peaceful towns.
[6665.14s - 6668.58s] What happened was the killing of the,
[6668.58s - 6669.94s] what people thought was the heir,
[6669.94s - 6672.26s] and he well may have been, of Chinggis Khan,
[6672.26s - 6675.94s] the killing of him revitalized a lot of people's hopes
[6675.94s - 6677.82s] and a lot of cities revolted.
[6677.82s - 6680.30s] The ones who did not revolt were not killed.
[6680.30s - 6682.78s] But the cities who revolted, he killed them all.
[6682.78s - 6684.66s] There was a mass slaughter.
[6684.66s - 6687.34s] There are estimates that Chinggis Khan
[6687.34s - 6690.06s] and his Mongol empire were responsible
[6690.06s - 6693.90s] for an estimated 40 million deaths,
[6693.90s - 6696.94s] approximately 10% of the world's population.
[6696.94s - 6699.78s] So to put this number in the perspective of the modern day,
[6699.78s - 6702.02s] that would be equivalent to killing
[6702.02s - 6704.82s] about 800 million people in today's population.
[6705.70s - 6708.30s] So how should we think about the brutality
[6708.30s - 6711.22s] of numbers like these?
[6711.22s - 6713.46s] The number itself is difficult to deal with.
[6713.46s - 6715.70s] Millions of people were killed.
[6715.70s - 6720.70s] For every family that lost someone, it's a total loss.
[6721.18s - 6723.26s] There's no, it doesn't matter what the number is.
[6723.26s - 6724.94s] It's a tremendous loss.
[6724.94s - 6729.62s] And there was tremendous loss of life as in every war.
[6729.62s - 6733.98s] I don't think we should judge him any differently
[6733.98s - 6736.42s] than other conquerors in history
[6736.50s - 6739.42s] and other countries today that fight wars,
[6739.42s - 6741.70s] including our own country.
[6741.70s - 6745.74s] If we, whatever we are willing to permit our country to do,
[6745.74s - 6747.30s] we should be able to understand
[6747.30s - 6750.46s] why Chinggis Khan or the Mongols did it.
[6750.46s - 6753.10s] You look today in the world,
[6753.10s - 6758.10s] people are killing children, women, civilians,
[6758.98s - 6761.26s] every day, every day.
[6761.26s - 6763.02s] And it's always in the name of something
[6763.02s - 6765.86s] in the name of peace or in the name of God
[6765.86s - 6768.02s] or in the name of our nation.
[6768.02s - 6770.34s] There are always reasons for the killing.
[6770.34s - 6775.22s] And the United States has certainly involved with that,
[6775.22s - 6777.10s] supplying the weapons for bombing people,
[6777.10s - 6782.02s] invading Afghanistan, fighting in Iraq,
[6782.02s - 6784.90s] fighting in Syria.
[6784.90s - 6786.82s] The United States is very involved in that.
[6786.82s - 6788.74s] And it's always, oh, but we're defending democracy.
[6788.74s - 6791.30s] And yeah, we bought a hell of a lot of democracy
[6791.30s - 6792.46s] to Afghanistan.
[6793.70s - 6795.22s] We killed a lot of people.
[6796.86s - 6799.78s] You can even look back to World War II,
[6799.78s - 6802.94s] our great moment of democracy and bringing freedom
[6802.94s - 6805.18s] and democracy to Germans.
[6805.18s - 6808.66s] We dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[6808.66s - 6810.58s] Those were not military targets.
[6810.58s - 6814.10s] We were not doing anything strategic against the country
[6814.10s - 6816.26s] other than terrorizing the country
[6816.26s - 6819.50s] by killing women and children.
[6819.50s - 6820.62s] That's America.
[6820.62s - 6821.82s] That's us.
[6821.82s - 6823.38s] My father fought in that war.
[6823.38s - 6825.14s] In fact, he fought in all, he fought in Vietnam.
[6825.14s - 6826.10s] He fought that war.
[6826.10s - 6827.30s] And he fought in Korea.
[6828.62s - 6830.82s] And he was a good American.
[6830.82s - 6832.22s] I mean, there was nothing wrong with it.
[6832.22s - 6835.82s] And I'm not, I don't even condemn America,
[6835.82s - 6839.26s] but I'm saying how can we condemn one set of people
[6839.26s - 6842.90s] for doing it and then excuse it in ourselves?
[6842.90s - 6844.38s] But we tend to do that.
[6844.38s - 6846.34s] We, especially barbarian people,
[6846.34s - 6848.82s] people from step, for example,
[6848.82s - 6852.22s] we tend to demonize them or any enemy we have,
[6852.22s - 6854.30s] we tend to demonize them.
[6854.30s - 6856.30s] You said a lot of interesting things there.
[6856.30s - 6860.02s] So one is just the very nature of war,
[6860.02s - 6861.10s] that war is hell.
[6864.34s - 6867.74s] That sometimes things like dropping the atomic bomb,
[6867.74s - 6870.94s] which is an act of essentially terror
[6871.90s - 6873.82s] in the same style as Genghis Khan
[6875.58s - 6880.02s] in an attempt to prevent further war.
[6880.02s - 6881.34s] It's a justification.
[6881.34s - 6883.58s] People are always fighting for peace,
[6883.58s - 6885.10s] always fighting for peace.
[6885.10s - 6887.06s] World War I was to make the world safe
[6887.06s - 6888.62s] for democracy and peace.
[6888.62s - 6890.86s] And in World War II, but what happened?
[6890.86s - 6892.26s] We went to war in Korea.
[6892.26s - 6893.82s] We went to war in Vietnam.
[6893.82s - 6894.94s] We bombed Cambodia.
[6894.94s - 6896.38s] We bombed Laos.
[6896.38s - 6897.70s] We bombed Afghanistan.
[6897.70s - 6899.38s] We bombed Syria.
[6899.38s - 6900.74s] We bombed Iraq.
[6900.74s - 6902.54s] We're always fighting for, you know,
[6902.54s - 6904.58s] and I'm not a pacifist.
[6904.58s - 6905.78s] I am not.
[6905.78s - 6908.26s] I grew up surrounded with soldiers
[6908.26s - 6910.02s] and I'm not a pacifist,
[6910.02s - 6912.10s] but I tried to be a realist
[6912.14s - 6914.14s] that all nations kill.
[6915.26s - 6916.78s] It happens everywhere.
[6916.78s - 6919.22s] So can we universally also then,
[6919.22s - 6921.22s] in the way you're passionately criticizing
[6921.22s - 6923.02s] wars of the 20th century,
[6923.02s - 6926.42s] can we also criticize Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great
[6926.42s - 6928.42s] and the wars fought by Caesar
[6928.42s - 6930.90s] and others in the Roman Empire,
[6930.90s - 6935.90s] that they're essentially wars of conquest.
[6936.10s - 6940.10s] And in some human way, we're not necessary
[6940.10s - 6942.46s] or we're not defensive.
[6942.46s - 6944.46s] They're just part of this human drive
[6944.46s - 6949.06s] to expand, to explore, and to accumulate power.
[6949.06s - 6951.34s] Maybe this is a good place to also talk about
[6951.34s - 6952.90s] somebody I respect a lot,
[6952.90s - 6956.70s] Dan Carlin of Hardcore History podcast.
[6956.70s - 6960.30s] He did an amazing series on Genghis Khan and the Mongols
[6960.30s - 6961.78s] called Wrath of the Khans.
[6961.78s - 6963.58s] I recommend people go listen to it.
[6964.86s - 6967.02s] So he had a lot of interesting ideas there.
[6967.02s - 6968.42s] One of them, he presented the idea
[6968.42s - 6971.58s] of historical arsonists,
[6971.58s - 6973.94s] so referring to figures who caused immense destruction
[6973.94s - 6977.22s] but also paved the way for new developments and progress.
[6978.54s - 6980.82s] Basically making this complicated case
[6980.82s - 6983.02s] that destruction often in history
[6983.02s - 6984.22s] paves the way for progress.
[6984.22s - 6986.42s] So what do you think about this idea?
[6986.42s - 6987.66s] Creative destruction,
[6987.66s - 6990.50s] it certainly works in some aspects of life.
[6990.50s - 6992.14s] Even with ourselves, for example,
[6992.14s - 6994.74s] if we can creatively destroy some of our habits
[6994.74s - 6997.46s] and build new ones, it sometimes works.
[6997.46s - 7000.98s] Or we can destroy relationships that we're in
[7000.98s - 7002.98s] in order to create new ones, it can work.
[7002.98s - 7006.02s] When you start applying it to world history,
[7006.02s - 7009.14s] it does become a little bit more difficult.
[7009.14s - 7013.98s] I certainly think that these episodes create great changes.
[7013.98s - 7015.66s] You can see great changes that happen
[7015.66s - 7018.30s] because of the Mongol Empire.
[7018.30s - 7021.14s] Now, whether or not that's a good reason
[7021.14s - 7024.22s] for the Mongol Empire having happened,
[7024.22s - 7027.50s] it seems like a bit of a stretch for me.
[7029.66s - 7032.50s] The Mongols helped to unify many countries.
[7032.50s - 7035.98s] You can think Korea had been three, basically, kingdoms,
[7035.98s - 7037.38s] pushed them together.
[7037.38s - 7039.22s] Everything that you see in China today
[7039.22s - 7041.02s] was a part of the Mongol Empire.
[7041.02s - 7043.66s] They put together North China, South China,
[7043.66s - 7047.70s] Tibet, Manchuria, and it was a little bit larger
[7047.70s - 7048.98s] under the Mongols.
[7048.98s - 7052.38s] Even Russia, with so many little kingdoms
[7052.38s - 7054.18s] and duchies and dukedoms,
[7054.18s - 7057.70s] and the center had been into Ukraine and Kiev.
[7057.70s - 7059.82s] They shifted the focus out of Ukraine
[7059.82s - 7062.26s] and more towards into what we call Russia now,
[7062.26s - 7064.90s] and they began the process of the unification
[7064.90s - 7067.22s] and had a great impact on the country.
[7067.22s - 7070.10s] So, in a way, it's a new creation.
[7070.10s - 7072.90s] Yes, it does arrive out of the destruction.
[7072.90s - 7074.14s] But also, I think we need to look
[7074.14s - 7075.90s] where does the destruction come from?
[7075.90s - 7078.62s] It often comes because the powers around them
[7078.62s - 7083.06s] have been so debilitated and so corrupted
[7083.06s - 7088.06s] and so decayed of their own lack of moral fiber
[7088.74s - 7091.78s] that it was easy to conquer them.
[7091.78s - 7095.10s] The case of Kublai Khan finally conquered all of China.
[7095.10s - 7098.86s] He was conquering a decayed dynasty.
[7098.86s - 7100.98s] When the Mongols conquered Baghdad
[7100.98s - 7102.74s] and overthrew the caliph,
[7102.74s - 7106.38s] they were conquering a very decayed institution.
[7106.58s - 7108.98s] No one likes war, and I certainly don't like war,
[7108.98s - 7110.66s] but I'm not 100% against it.
[7110.66s - 7111.98s] I think that there are times
[7114.18s - 7117.82s] that people are going to do it for their own protection,
[7117.82s - 7120.46s] if nothing else, of their family,
[7120.46s - 7123.38s] and it's justified in that sense to themselves.
[7123.38s - 7125.98s] It may not be justified in a world sense,
[7125.98s - 7130.34s] but I just make the case for being tolerant
[7130.34s - 7131.50s] of what the Mongols did
[7131.50s - 7134.10s] if we can tolerate what the Americans did.
[7134.10s - 7135.82s] And I am American, true and true.
[7135.82s - 7138.18s] There's no question about that.
[7138.18s - 7141.78s] But we overlook all of our things that we did.
[7141.78s - 7144.74s] That's interesting, for example, in Afghanistan.
[7144.74s - 7146.74s] We were there for some 20 years.
[7146.74s - 7149.34s] We had made the Taliban stronger before,
[7149.34s - 7151.02s] when they were fighting against the Russians,
[7151.02s - 7154.14s] and then we kicked them out, and then they kicked us out.
[7154.14s - 7157.78s] But some of the Taliban leaders are from the Jadran clan,
[7157.78s - 7162.78s] the descended from Jamuk family, from his clan.
[7163.62s - 7167.46s] This is what I mean when I say that the ramifications
[7167.46s - 7171.90s] from that time are still with us, and we don't even see it.
[7172.90s - 7175.46s] And when Saddam Hussein went on television
[7175.46s - 7179.78s] for the last time in Iraq to plead with his people,
[7179.78s - 7182.50s] he said, the Mongols, meaning Americans,
[7182.50s - 7186.82s] the Mongols have returned, the Mongols have returned.
[7186.82s - 7189.38s] And he said, the Americans are just the new Mongols.
[7189.66s - 7192.78s] And I can see it.
[7192.78s - 7197.34s] I don't accept it, but I can see how people think.
[7197.34s - 7199.22s] If we can be honest with ourselves
[7199.22s - 7202.46s] and strip away our own lies about ourselves,
[7202.46s - 7204.30s] then perhaps we will be more ethical
[7204.30s - 7206.10s] in our dealings with other people.
[7207.26s - 7209.42s] And there's effects that you could talk about.
[7209.42s - 7212.22s] I mean, the unification of China, Mongols or otherwise,
[7212.22s - 7215.46s] is a very important step in the history of China
[7215.46s - 7218.58s] that permeates to today.
[7218.62s - 7220.70s] And then there's a lot of stuff that we'll talk about,
[7220.70s - 7223.90s] the ideas of religious freedom, the postal network,
[7223.90s - 7226.30s] the trade routes, all of this.
[7226.30s - 7229.58s] There's a lot of progressive consequences
[7229.58s - 7234.02s] of the Mongol conquest and the Mongol empire.
[7234.02s - 7235.62s] We'll talk about that, but let's linger
[7235.62s - 7238.82s] on the heavier topic for a little bit longer.
[7238.82s - 7240.74s] Like we were talking about Dan Carlin,
[7240.74s - 7245.74s] he was critical of your work a little bit,
[7246.74s - 7249.34s] showing it respect, but also a little bit critical
[7249.34s - 7252.34s] as being a bit too emphasizing and focusing
[7257.02s - 7260.46s] a lot on the positive impacts, correctly and accurately,
[7260.46s - 7264.66s] but not giving enough air time or describing
[7264.66s - 7269.66s] the brutality of the killing, the hell that is war.
[7270.02s - 7272.78s] So can you understand his criticism?
[7272.78s - 7274.66s] Guilty, I'm guilty.
[7274.70s - 7275.54s] Steel man.
[7277.30s - 7278.62s] Carlin's a very smart man.
[7278.62s - 7281.62s] I respect him very much and I like him tremendously.
[7281.62s - 7286.02s] And he's right, but that is not what I want to stress.
[7286.02s - 7289.30s] It's not that I want to deny the killing.
[7289.30s - 7291.82s] It's not that I want to deny the warfare,
[7291.82s - 7294.10s] but that's pretty much the same everywhere in the world.
[7294.10s - 7296.70s] And how much do we need to say about
[7298.30s - 7303.30s] how the wall was broken down, how this unit was defeated?
[7303.58s - 7306.46s] No, it's what comes afterwards.
[7306.46s - 7309.46s] Just as the story of our life begins far earlier
[7309.46s - 7311.86s] than we are born, the story of our life
[7311.86s - 7314.42s] goes on for a long time afterwards.
[7314.42s - 7317.58s] If you have a nation of 1 million people
[7318.54s - 7323.54s] and you are ruling over hundreds of millions of people,
[7323.58s - 7325.58s] hundreds of millions of people,
[7325.58s - 7328.18s] China, Russia, the Middle East,
[7328.18s - 7330.58s] you do not do that through warfare.
[7330.58s - 7332.74s] You conquer them initially through warfare,
[7332.74s - 7335.14s] but you do not rule them through warfare.
[7335.14s - 7337.86s] You've got to be offering something that they want,
[7337.86s - 7339.22s] something that they like.
[7339.22s - 7341.54s] And all the things you've mentioned
[7341.54s - 7344.10s] from the trading system, the postal system,
[7344.10s - 7346.06s] the religious freedom, the rights of women,
[7346.06s - 7347.90s] the rights of minorities,
[7347.90s - 7351.14s] these were things that people responded to.
[7351.14s - 7354.62s] And so the world benefited tremendously
[7355.54s - 7357.30s] from the life of Chinggis Khan.
[7357.30s - 7359.98s] But all we want to talk about, and I don't deny it,
[7359.98s - 7361.82s] is the conquest part.
[7361.82s - 7363.86s] Okay, that's 20 years.
[7363.86s - 7366.34s] If it went on for another 150 years,
[7367.38s - 7370.14s] there's more to the story than just conquest.
[7370.14s - 7373.82s] And there is a point that you correctly identify,
[7373.82s - 7376.46s] and you've also written about Native Americans and so on,
[7376.46s - 7381.46s] that history does seem to be written by the non-barbarians,
[7382.10s - 7386.06s] but in reality, history is not divided in this kind of way
[7386.06s - 7388.82s] and the barbarians are not these crude,
[7388.82s - 7391.50s] brutal, plain, simple people
[7391.54s - 7394.54s] that there is a sophisticated, deep culture
[7394.54s - 7396.18s] within them as well.
[7396.18s - 7400.22s] All the different kinds of peoples that came from the steppe.
[7400.22s - 7401.18s] Yes.
[7401.18s - 7403.54s] I guess if there's one thing that I try to do
[7403.54s - 7405.34s] in my career of writing,
[7405.34s - 7408.54s] it is to get us to recognize the importance
[7408.54s - 7411.02s] of tribal people in the history of the world.
[7411.02s - 7413.26s] We tend to have two categories for them.
[7413.26s - 7416.70s] There are barbarians who kill people and eat one another,
[7416.70s - 7419.14s] or they're victims and we should feel sorry for them
[7419.14s - 7421.50s] and nostalgic about everything about them
[7421.50s - 7424.42s] and maybe wear some of their beads or some of their clothing
[7424.42s - 7428.06s] to show how much we sympathize with their suffering.
[7428.06s - 7430.58s] That's the two roles for tribal people.
[7430.58s - 7432.98s] But I'm trying to show them in a different light
[7432.98s - 7435.90s] that they conquered, yes, they were conquered,
[7435.90s - 7438.22s] but they also created great things
[7438.22s - 7440.06s] in the history of the world.
[7440.06s - 7442.58s] And that the Mongol Empire was really
[7442.58s - 7444.98s] the first modern empire in the way
[7444.98s - 7447.38s] that I'm putting together that story.
[7447.46s - 7450.78s] And Chinggis Khan was the genius behind that,
[7450.78s - 7455.34s] who created this idea that there could be one world
[7455.34s - 7457.82s] in which there would be one set of supreme law,
[7457.82s - 7460.18s] but all people could follow their own law.
[7460.18s - 7462.46s] You could have any religion you wanted,
[7462.46s - 7464.74s] but ultimately you had to obey kind of
[7464.74s - 7466.62s] the great ethics of the sky.
[7466.62s - 7469.62s] And there were things like that about his vision
[7470.86s - 7475.66s] that I think very few people in history had a vision.
[7475.70s - 7478.02s] And I look around the world today,
[7478.02s - 7483.02s] and in my lifetime since the time of Roosevelt's death,
[7483.54s - 7487.42s] I look around, I don't see much vision.
[7487.42s - 7491.86s] I see lots of slogans, lots of talks, policy papers.
[7491.86s - 7493.86s] Oh my God, we can produce it.
[7495.26s - 7497.02s] Where's the vision?
[7497.02s - 7498.70s] It's always, we're gonna have peace
[7498.70s - 7499.78s] and we're gonna have a better life
[7499.78s - 7502.62s] and vote for me or vote for my party.
[7502.62s - 7504.90s] And we're really for the people
[7504.98s - 7508.98s] and we're, what the heck are they talking about?
[7508.98s - 7510.98s] There is no vision there.
[7510.98s - 7512.22s] So what is this country?
[7512.22s - 7513.38s] What should this country be?
[7513.38s - 7514.30s] What is this world?
[7514.30s - 7515.18s] How should we?
[7515.18s - 7516.74s] No, no vision.
[7516.74s - 7519.94s] Well, those figures, I mean, they're rare through history.
[7519.94s - 7522.70s] The legendary figures that come along that have vision,
[7522.70s - 7527.70s] but are able to capture the public imagination
[7528.02s - 7530.22s] and hearts and minds with the vision,
[7530.22s - 7534.94s] but also have the skill to execute and implement it
[7534.94s - 7537.30s] and all of those things combined
[7537.30s - 7541.34s] and have the mental fortitude not to be corrupted
[7541.34s - 7544.22s] by success along the way, all of those things.
[7544.22s - 7546.30s] That's very rare in history.
[7546.30s - 7547.58s] And when they come along,
[7547.58s - 7549.66s] they change the direction of history.
[7549.66s - 7554.66s] If we could linger on some of these world-defining ideas,
[7554.70s - 7559.70s] religious freedom is, it's just surprising
[7560.46s - 7565.46s] and incredible that Genghis Khan was able to enforce,
[7566.54s - 7569.78s] inspire the value of religious freedom
[7569.78s - 7571.70s] throughout all of these disparate lands
[7571.70s - 7575.06s] for whom religion was a very powerful force.
[7575.06s - 7576.54s] So can you speak to that?
[7576.54s - 7579.10s] Some empires in history and some rulers
[7579.10s - 7581.74s] have been tolerant of various groups.
[7581.74s - 7584.10s] I mean, Rome to some extent was reasonably tolerant
[7584.10s - 7586.10s] of different sects and religions,
[7586.10s - 7588.70s] not of the Christians, but reasonably.
[7588.70s - 7591.62s] But what happened with Genghis Khan,
[7592.66s - 7596.14s] the first campaign he had outside of Mongolia
[7596.14s - 7599.34s] was for the Uyghur people who lived in Western China.
[7599.34s - 7602.14s] They at that time were being ruled by,
[7602.14s - 7605.90s] actually we had mentioned before the Niman King Tayang Khan.
[7605.90s - 7610.90s] His son, Guxluk, had fled, no good worthless son,
[7612.22s - 7617.22s] but Guxluk had fled into what is today the area
[7617.38s - 7622.38s] around Kyrgyzstan and they ruled over the Uyghur people.
[7622.66s - 7625.74s] He had been a Christian, the Niman had been a Christian tribe,
[7625.74s - 7627.46s] but he converted to Buddhism.
[7627.46s - 7629.58s] Well, his subjects were Muslim
[7629.58s - 7631.62s] and he outlawed the Muslim religion
[7631.62s - 7633.86s] and he made all kinds of things happen.
[7633.86s - 7637.18s] So the Uyghurs sent a delegation to Genghis Khan.
[7637.18s - 7639.94s] At this time, they knew that the emperors of China
[7639.94s - 7641.34s] were too weak to protect them,
[7641.34s - 7643.22s] so they sent delegation to Genghis Khan
[7643.22s - 7646.50s] and asked him to come and save them from him.
[7646.50s - 7649.18s] And he did, he sent down a detachment,
[7649.18s - 7650.26s] he didn't actually go himself,
[7650.26s - 7651.90s] he sent the detachment down there.
[7651.90s - 7653.50s] They drove Guxluk from power,
[7653.50s - 7658.02s] Guxluk fled down towards Pakistan in that direction.
[7658.02s - 7659.74s] They caught up with him, they killed him.
[7659.74s - 7662.14s] That's what the Mongols did.
[7662.14s - 7665.22s] And then Genghis Khan made the first law
[7665.22s - 7668.34s] that he ever made for people outside of Mongolia.
[7668.34s - 7671.02s] So up to this point, it's been tribal law.
[7671.02s - 7673.54s] And he saw, as we mentioned before,
[7673.54s - 7676.06s] that for the tribes were mostly fighting over women,
[7676.06s - 7678.26s] so you outlaw the kidnapping of women,
[7678.26s - 7679.78s] you outlaw the sale of women,
[7679.78s - 7682.58s] and you cut down on a lot of the feuding.
[7682.58s - 7685.46s] But he saw that civilized, quote unquote,
[7685.46s - 7688.90s] people fought a lot over religion.
[7688.90s - 7689.94s] They weren't fighting over women,
[7689.94s - 7691.38s] they were fighting over religion.
[7691.38s - 7693.66s] And so he made the law.
[7693.66s - 7695.46s] Now this was very interesting.
[7695.46s - 7696.62s] We talk about religious freedom.
[7696.62s - 7699.38s] Religious freedom comes in many forms.
[7699.38s - 7704.38s] One form is to allow institutions to do what they want.
[7704.74s - 7709.02s] So we're gonna allow the Mormons and the Catholics
[7709.02s - 7711.62s] and the Jews and the Muslims each to do what they want
[7711.62s - 7714.58s] in the organized churches that they have.
[7714.58s - 7715.98s] His law was not that.
[7715.98s - 7718.02s] It had presumed that, it allowed that.
[7718.02s - 7721.22s] But he said every person has the right
[7721.22s - 7723.34s] to choose their religion.
[7723.34s - 7727.22s] No one can stop them, no one can force them.
[7727.22s - 7729.50s] The idea that it was individual choice,
[7729.50s - 7731.98s] no one in history had ever thought of that,
[7731.98s - 7733.78s] that it belonged to the person.
[7734.02s - 7736.58s] That's a really, really powerful statement.
[7736.58s - 7739.10s] That alone, that's why you talk about Thomas Jefferson
[7739.10s - 7742.38s] being deeply inspired by Genghis Khan.
[7745.06s - 7747.10s] Religious freedom, yes, of the individual,
[7747.10s - 7751.42s] but it's such a powerful illustration,
[7751.42s - 7754.70s] manifestation of just individual freedom, period.
[7755.62s - 7759.94s] If you in the world, in history,
[7759.94s - 7763.54s] are allowed to practice any religion you want,
[7764.62s - 7769.62s] that's, I mean, that is like one of the biggest way
[7770.02s - 7772.10s] to say that the individual is fundamentally free
[7772.10s - 7773.38s] in this society.
[7773.38s - 7776.94s] Yes, there was a great source of power for him also.
[7776.94s - 7778.74s] You know, I don't say that he did this
[7778.74s - 7781.14s] because of some ideological reason.
[7781.14s - 7783.78s] It's just like he didn't outlaw the kidnapping of women
[7783.78s - 7785.14s] for ideological reasons.
[7785.14s - 7788.26s] He didn't come to it through studying ideas of moral right.
[7788.26s - 7790.54s] He came to it through practical experience of life.
[7790.54s - 7793.98s] His mother was kidnapped, his wife was kidnapped.
[7793.98s - 7797.54s] He knew that that was a crime against every ethics
[7797.54s - 7800.10s] that you can think of and every form of morality.
[7800.10s - 7801.22s] That's why he did it.
[7801.22s - 7803.94s] Not for ideological reasons, but practical reasons.
[7803.94s - 7806.18s] It hurt people, it hurt people.
[7806.18s - 7808.42s] It was the same with religion.
[7808.42s - 7810.26s] He gave this right to everybody
[7810.26s - 7813.18s] because it was gonna be their own personal right
[7813.18s - 7815.26s] to keep them from being hurt.
[7815.26s - 7817.66s] And then that gave him tremendous support
[7817.66s - 7820.10s] from minorities of many types.
[7821.34s - 7822.90s] And so they flocked to him.
[7822.90s - 7825.86s] Minorities, after that, this was a minority effort
[7825.86s - 7827.98s] of the Muslim Uyghurs to come to him.
[7827.98s - 7830.62s] Many people flocked to him for the same reason,
[7830.62s - 7832.82s] for that kind of religious freedom.
[7832.82s - 7834.02s] So that religious freedom
[7834.02s - 7835.74s] and also the other things you mentioned,
[7835.74s - 7837.38s] they create a stable society.
[7837.38s - 7842.22s] And that allows him with a small army
[7842.22s - 7844.98s] to administer a large empire.
[7845.02s - 7848.10s] And also I will say in a more practical,
[7848.10s - 7850.26s] political sort of way of thinking,
[7850.26s - 7854.10s] he recognized the power of having a balance of power
[7854.10s - 7856.82s] of like Shiite and Sunni,
[7856.82s - 7860.66s] that both are gonna be allowed equal rights.
[7860.66s - 7862.54s] One is not dominant over the other.
[7862.54s - 7866.10s] And Christians and Jews, they all have,
[7866.10s - 7871.10s] well, that keeps the society from fragmenting against him
[7871.90s - 7873.50s] or uniting against him.
[7873.54s - 7875.86s] And it's a kind of fragmentation
[7875.86s - 7877.62s] that he's taken advantage of.
[7877.62s - 7879.26s] I don't think that was his main reason,
[7879.26s - 7881.58s] but I do think he was quite aware of that,
[7881.58s - 7883.54s] that you give every religion the right.
[7884.74s - 7889.54s] Unfortunately, the only religion he didn't recognize
[7889.54s - 7892.26s] as a religion was Confucianism.
[7892.26s - 7893.66s] He said, what do they do?
[7894.90s - 7896.98s] The Taoists can do magic on the earth
[7896.98s - 7899.86s] and they can give people magic formulas
[7899.86s - 7903.02s] and they have all this kind of stuff going on.
[7903.02s - 7904.34s] Well, what did the Confucianist do?
[7904.34s - 7907.58s] So still the people could be Confucianist, that was okay,
[7907.58s - 7910.98s] but he didn't expend all the tax-free rights.
[7910.98s - 7911.86s] See, that was another thing,
[7911.86s - 7916.54s] he dropped all taxes on religious institutions, all types,
[7916.54s - 7921.26s] but since the Confucianists were not necessarily classified.
[7921.26s - 7924.62s] But then of course, eventually that was abused so much
[7924.62s - 7926.62s] because the religions were then,
[7926.62s - 7928.54s] again, everybody didn't own a property,
[7928.54s - 7930.46s] you can still use it, you can still farm your land,
[7930.46s - 7932.98s] but it's ours and now you don't have to pay taxes on it,
[7933.82s - 7936.06s] you can just give us some money, you know, got abused,
[7936.06s - 7937.82s] but it started off as a good idea.
[7939.10s - 7941.94s] And genuinely, as I understand, maybe you can correct me,
[7943.10s - 7947.34s] of course, there's the practical aspect of those policies,
[7947.34s - 7949.30s] but he himself was just curious
[7949.30s - 7953.22s] about the different religions as well, as I understand.
[7953.22s - 7956.42s] So he never chose any religion
[7956.42s - 7959.82s] except the one from which he came, I guess.
[7959.82s - 7962.02s] I mean, can you describe
[7962.02s - 7965.70s] what he believed spiritually himself?
[7965.70s - 7968.34s] It's interesting, you know, we said after the death
[7968.34s - 7970.98s] of Sirimon, his grandson in Bamiyan,
[7970.98s - 7973.30s] and the slaughter that followed that,
[7973.30s - 7975.54s] he went through a new phase
[7975.54s - 7980.54s] in which he summoned religious scholars of all sorts,
[7980.70s - 7984.34s] of famous Cheng Chang from China, who I despise,
[7984.34s - 7987.86s] but anyway, he came with all of his magic formulas
[7988.66s - 7991.78s] and then a bunch of various Muslim leaders came.
[7991.78s - 7995.34s] So Ching's Han was exploring all these different religions
[7995.34s - 7997.26s] and not just in a simple way,
[7997.26s - 8001.66s] he had organized public lectures from these people
[8001.66s - 8005.78s] and public debates, not antagonistic debates,
[8005.78s - 8007.86s] but discussions among groups of people
[8007.86s - 8011.02s] who hated each other and would never discuss anything,
[8011.02s - 8013.78s] and suddenly this powerful man summons them
[8013.78s - 8016.46s] and he has to say, okay, well, explain your religion
[8016.46s - 8017.50s] and explain yours.
[8017.50s - 8020.38s] And even sometimes you can't just explain it
[8020.38s - 8022.70s] in terms of your own scripture.
[8022.70s - 8024.34s] What do you say to the people who believe it?
[8024.34s - 8028.26s] So he was exploring, but no, he never changed at all.
[8028.26s - 8030.34s] He was an animist, we would say,
[8030.34s - 8033.30s] that's not the only term we know to use.
[8034.42s - 8036.46s] Early in life, he worshiped that mountain
[8036.46s - 8040.42s] where he took refuge several times, Burhan Haldun.
[8040.42s - 8043.62s] Burhan Haldun was the great refuge of his life.
[8043.62s - 8046.38s] He would go to the top, he would pray,
[8046.42s - 8049.30s] he would take off his hat, he would take off his belt,
[8049.30s - 8052.22s] he would stand there before the sky and pray.
[8052.22s - 8054.78s] Also later on, actually, this became rather dramatic.
[8054.78s - 8056.66s] He would sometimes go away to pray,
[8056.66s - 8058.02s] should we invade these people?
[8058.02s - 8061.58s] And so all of the subjects are waiting to hear
[8061.58s - 8063.34s] what's God gonna tell Ching's Han
[8063.34s - 8065.14s] when he goes up the mountain.
[8065.14s - 8066.78s] And so there are episodes like that,
[8066.78s - 8068.62s] but he was very sincere.
[8068.62s - 8070.30s] But I think what happened,
[8070.30s - 8073.14s] the Mongols have so many spirits in the water,
[8073.14s - 8075.34s] the mountains, everything around them,
[8075.38s - 8078.22s] and you have to know them personally
[8078.22s - 8081.14s] and pray to them and know what they like and don't like.
[8081.14s - 8083.22s] And should you sing to them
[8083.22s - 8087.22s] or should you offer some milk products or what do you do?
[8087.22s - 8088.06s] You have to know them.
[8088.06s - 8089.82s] Well, you get away from Mongolia,
[8089.82s - 8091.50s] and this was a problem in China,
[8091.50s - 8093.42s] they didn't know the spirits.
[8093.42s - 8096.54s] This caused great consternation for the Mongols.
[8096.54s - 8098.94s] You've got a land here and the spirits don't like us,
[8098.94s - 8101.18s] they're hostile lands, we don't even know who they are.
[8101.18s - 8103.10s] We don't know these spirits in China.
[8103.10s - 8104.22s] It took a long time.
[8104.30s - 8106.86s] And so gradually Ching's Han,
[8108.18s - 8111.82s] he kind of moved from just the spirit of the mountain
[8111.82s - 8112.98s] that he worshiped,
[8112.98s - 8116.66s] which remained his main focus of worship his whole life.
[8116.66s - 8118.18s] He removed that to the sky.
[8118.18s - 8120.42s] That was the one universal spirit.
[8120.42s - 8122.78s] It was everywhere in the world.
[8122.78s - 8125.18s] The sky was the same for every people.
[8125.18s - 8127.38s] And so for the Mongolians in their language,
[8128.22s - 8131.50s] the word for sky and the word for heaven
[8131.50s - 8134.58s] and the word for God and the word for weather
[8134.58s - 8136.14s] are all the same.
[8136.14s - 8138.18s] Tinger, tinger.
[8138.18s - 8142.50s] And so our Mongolian tinger in the case of the eternal sky,
[8142.50s - 8144.42s] when they're talking about it in religious terms,
[8144.42s - 8145.74s] the eternal blue sky.
[8146.78s - 8151.70s] So he became more universalistic
[8151.70s - 8154.38s] in this animist vision of the world.
[8154.38s - 8157.62s] And so then the sky could embrace all religions,
[8157.62s - 8161.10s] all religions and all people were trying to attain
[8161.10s - 8163.26s] the same form of enlightenment.
[8163.26s - 8166.10s] Well, enlightenment is too specific a word,
[8166.10s - 8169.66s] but the same form of moral life and guidance from the sky.
[8169.66s - 8173.98s] He felt that each person knew morality.
[8173.98s - 8176.58s] Each person could communicate a no morality
[8176.58s - 8177.82s] within themselves.
[8177.82s - 8179.74s] They didn't have to just be taught it
[8179.74s - 8181.54s] by somebody from a book.
[8181.54s - 8184.74s] And in fact, as one of his grandson, Monk Han said,
[8186.18s - 8187.90s] you people talking to all the others,
[8187.90s - 8190.54s] to the Christians, the Jews, the Muslims,
[8190.54s - 8193.58s] the Taoists, said, you people have your scriptures
[8193.58s - 8195.38s] and you don't live by them.
[8195.38s - 8198.14s] We have our spirits and our shamans and our drums
[8198.14s - 8199.38s] and we live by them.
[8200.42s - 8201.54s] And I think it's true.
[8202.42s - 8204.22s] It's just throughout this conversation,
[8204.22s - 8208.70s] it's just blowing my mind that the kid from the Mongol step
[8208.70s - 8210.62s] that lost everything, right?
[8210.62s - 8215.30s] Lost, just had the hardest of lives is now,
[8215.98s - 8220.98s] yes, a military genius,
[8221.42s - 8225.38s] but also this kind of sage type character
[8225.38s - 8227.66s] to understand the value of religious freedom.
[8227.66s - 8230.70s] I mean, there is a cynical way to see all these things
[8230.70s - 8233.34s] because he did awfully a lot of things
[8233.34s - 8235.10s] that look like he's a feminist.
[8236.34s - 8240.14s] And you're saying, well, the cynical way to see that
[8240.14s - 8242.54s] is what he saw the value of promoting women
[8242.54s - 8244.10s] in positions of power
[8244.10s - 8246.86s] because they create a more stable society
[8246.86s - 8249.42s] and there's less power struggles, all that.
[8249.42s - 8252.34s] But the reality is there's a lot of things
[8252.34s - 8253.98s] that look awfully progressive
[8253.98s - 8256.54s] about the things he's implemented and they stayed.
[8256.54s - 8258.82s] I'm not trying to say it in modern terms.
[8259.78s - 8262.62s] When you have 1 million people, you've got to use every one.
[8262.62s - 8264.94s] And the men are fighting and so he left women
[8264.94s - 8267.54s] to administer a lot of things inside the country,
[8267.54s - 8269.26s] the economy in particular,
[8269.26s - 8272.70s] and then in some of the ancillary Turkic kingdoms
[8272.70s - 8275.06s] around the Mongols, such as the Angut,
[8275.06s - 8278.30s] the Tarlik and different Mongol and the Uyghur
[8278.30s - 8282.46s] even were administered by his daughters primarily.
[8282.46s - 8285.22s] And then his wives were in charge of administering
[8285.22s - 8289.10s] the land of Mongolia itself and handling the economy.
[8289.10s - 8293.22s] So he was using the women, but in a very practical way,
[8294.10s - 8297.66s] but it wasn't necessarily in our ideological way.
[8297.66s - 8299.98s] I think it's the same with the environment.
[8299.98s - 8302.14s] I'm not trying to say he was environmentalist
[8302.14s - 8305.62s] in our modern way, but he passed very strict laws
[8305.62s - 8310.22s] about the use of water and also about not using water,
[8310.22s - 8314.06s] that you couldn't move water into an area to irrigate it.
[8314.06s - 8317.26s] That was violating the earth and violating the water.
[8317.26s - 8319.18s] So they think, a lot of the historians,
[8319.18s - 8320.58s] they think the Mongols are so stupid,
[8320.58s - 8322.90s] they let the irrigation system be destroyed.
[8322.90s - 8325.86s] No, it takes more work to destroy an irrigation system
[8325.86s - 8327.34s] than it does to create it.
[8327.34s - 8329.90s] They destroyed those systems out of a policy.
[8329.98s - 8333.18s] And that was, this is gonna return to pasture land.
[8334.42s - 8336.30s] Just last year Kublai Khan was the one
[8336.30s - 8339.10s] who changed that actually, and then started allowing
[8339.10s - 8342.18s] for more irrigation and the movement of water and things.
[8342.18s - 8346.22s] But Chinggis Khan, we can't use these modern terms
[8346.22s - 8349.22s] of like a human rights crusader,
[8349.22s - 8351.82s] or I'm trying to say he's a Democrat in the modern sense
[8351.82s - 8354.06s] or environmentalist or a feminist,
[8354.06s - 8356.34s] but all of this was a part of it.
[8356.34s - 8359.46s] Another part was the protection of envoys.
[8359.50s - 8363.02s] He said every envoy, every ambassador, every messenger
[8364.02s - 8367.38s] is protected from arrest, from torture, and from killing.
[8367.38s - 8372.38s] And if you kill one of ours, we will wipe you out.
[8375.70s - 8378.90s] And in 1240, that was the destruction of Kiev.
[8378.90s - 8380.82s] This is after Chinggis Khan already.
[8380.82s - 8384.98s] There's Aguday Khan, his son, the happy, happy drunk.
[8384.98s - 8388.26s] Aguday Khan's army had come there under Subodai,
[8389.02s - 8390.74s] the greatest general in the history of the world,
[8390.74s - 8393.02s] I would say, Subodai, a person who's not Subodai.
[8393.02s - 8395.50s] Was it Chinggis Khan for the military part?
[8395.50s - 8396.98s] He was the greatest strategist
[8396.98s - 8399.34s] for organizing everything together.
[8399.34s - 8401.38s] But the military part was Subodai.
[8401.38s - 8404.42s] So Subodai had been there, and they sent in an ambassador
[8404.42s - 8406.26s] who happened to be a woman.
[8406.26s - 8410.14s] Now some of the Western sources say a daughter of Chinggis Khan.
[8410.14s - 8413.34s] I have no evidence of that, and I don't quite believe it,
[8413.34s - 8415.70s] but maybe she was kin to him or something.
[8415.70s - 8417.66s] Some say she was a daughter of Chinggis Khan.
[8417.70s - 8419.06s] Others say she was a witch.
[8420.02s - 8423.02s] The people of Kiev decided she was a witch and killed her.
[8423.98s - 8427.22s] Okay, that's it, that's it.
[8428.22s - 8432.06s] Kiev was destroyed for killing a Mongol envoy.
[8432.06s - 8437.14s] The envoy is a method of communication and diplomacy.
[8437.14s - 8439.78s] And so if you destroy that method of communication
[8439.78s - 8442.18s] or disrespect it in any way.
[8442.18s - 8443.18s] Exactly.
[8443.18s - 8445.46s] And that sends a signal to everybody else.
[8445.46s - 8448.50s] You send an envoy, you respect it.
[8448.50s - 8450.34s] That's why these plans,
[8450.34s - 8452.46s] I say that the making of the modern world,
[8452.46s - 8453.90s] most of the ideas have,
[8453.90s - 8456.86s] we accept the idea we don't do the practice.
[8456.86s - 8459.38s] All of us accept today diplomatic freedom.
[8459.38s - 8462.02s] Diplomats are killed around the world yearly.
[8462.02s - 8464.62s] We accept the idea of female equality
[8464.62s - 8466.42s] and emancipation of every way.
[8466.42s - 8467.82s] But in fact, they're enslaved
[8467.82s - 8469.90s] in many parts of the world today.
[8470.82s - 8473.70s] We accept the idea of religious freedom.
[8473.70s - 8475.26s] Oh, but not those people.
[8476.22s - 8478.98s] Theirs isn't good, their religion isn't right.
[8478.98s - 8481.50s] But our religion, we will tolerate them,
[8481.50s - 8484.14s] but they gotta be more like, no.
[8484.14s - 8485.66s] We only say these things,
[8485.66s - 8487.82s] but the world still hasn't achieved something.
[8487.82s - 8492.66s] And he did achieve these within his empire in his time.
[8492.66s - 8493.94s] He achieved those.
[8493.94s - 8496.10s] So one of the things we've mentioned,
[8496.10s - 8499.06s] but I think is really, really fascinating
[8499.06s - 8502.14s] and maybe in a measurable impact
[8502.14s - 8504.90s] that Genghis Khan had is on trade.
[8505.94s - 8507.78s] And you could say a lot of stuff,
[8507.78s - 8511.22s] but basically establishing a unified trade network
[8511.22s - 8515.06s] that spanned I don't know how many thousands of kilometers.
[8516.34s - 8518.66s] And there's a lot of interesting things
[8518.66s - 8520.94s] that were done to enable that trade.
[8520.94s - 8525.42s] One is providing safety and security
[8525.42s - 8528.22s] of not just the envoys, like we mentioned,
[8528.22s - 8531.14s] for communication in the military context,
[8531.14s - 8533.30s] but for the merchants.
[8533.30s - 8536.30s] Can you speak to what Genghis Khan did
[8536.30s - 8538.14s] for the trade network connected
[8538.14s - 8540.14s] to the Silk Road as an example?
[8540.14s - 8542.98s] Nomads in general are interested in trade.
[8542.98s - 8544.10s] And throughout most of history,
[8544.10s - 8546.82s] they have been the traders who carried the goods
[8546.82s - 8549.86s] from one city to another or one oasis to another.
[8549.86s - 8553.26s] And so the Mongols were also extremely interested
[8553.26s - 8554.86s] and extremely dependent.
[8554.86s - 8557.06s] They could create very little in their home country.
[8557.06s - 8559.02s] They couldn't grow hardly anything
[8559.02s - 8561.06s] and they didn't have the technological skills
[8561.06s - 8562.90s] for most of the crafts.
[8562.90s - 8564.82s] So they're very dependent on trade.
[8565.94s - 8570.18s] Well, they raised the status of merchants very high.
[8570.18s - 8572.94s] This was particularly a problem in the Chinese world.
[8572.94s - 8576.22s] It wasn't so much in the Christian or the Muslim world,
[8576.22s - 8578.10s] but certainly in the Chinese world,
[8578.10s - 8580.78s] where merchants were considered extremely low.
[8580.78s - 8583.74s] And all of a sudden he raises them up above scholars.
[8583.74s - 8585.78s] They're going to have certain rights.
[8585.78s - 8589.50s] For example, they get to be taxed one time.
[8589.50s - 8591.70s] Whatever the national taxes, that's it.
[8591.74s - 8595.26s] They're not taxed every time they stop in some new town.
[8595.26s - 8600.26s] And he created a set of what we would call rest houses
[8600.74s - 8605.74s] or recuperation centers where they could get fresh horses,
[8606.70s - 8610.42s] they could get food, they could deposit their money
[8610.42s - 8612.42s] and get paper receipts that could be used
[8612.42s - 8614.78s] anywhere in the empire.
[8614.78s - 8616.18s] They were guaranteed protection.
[8616.18s - 8617.62s] If they had to pass through an area
[8617.62s - 8621.06s] where it might be dangerous, then a small group,
[8621.06s - 8624.90s] a squad of men and horses would go with them.
[8624.90s - 8627.14s] So trade was extremely important.
[8627.14s - 8630.38s] And then the Mongols, they also,
[8630.38s - 8633.02s] they supported trade in a very odd way.
[8633.02s - 8634.66s] And that is the merchants would come in
[8634.66s - 8638.50s] and they would ask for an outrageous price for some goods,
[8638.50s - 8640.42s] you know, much more than they should get,
[8640.42s - 8642.66s] waiting for the Mongols to bargain them down.
[8644.18s - 8645.50s] And the Mongols would say,
[8646.62s - 8648.94s] I'll give you much more than that.
[8649.90s - 8652.06s] And as his grandson or his son,
[8652.06s - 8654.38s] Ogede Khan was once asked, why do you do that?
[8654.38s - 8655.22s] You've got to stop doing that.
[8655.22s - 8659.30s] This was a Muslim financial advisor, he'd called him.
[8659.30s - 8660.62s] He told him, well, you've got to stop paying
[8660.62s - 8662.14s] more than people ask.
[8662.14s - 8666.06s] And Ogede said, where's the money gonna go?
[8666.06s - 8667.34s] It's still in my empire.
[8667.34s - 8669.94s] It's gonna come back eventually, you know?
[8669.94s - 8672.14s] And so they had a much different attitude
[8672.14s - 8673.14s] with great respect.
[8673.14s - 8677.26s] And I think a symbol of that is in the time of Kubla Khan
[8677.30s - 8679.94s] when we see that his uncle and father went to China
[8679.94s - 8681.46s] and came back from China.
[8681.46s - 8683.10s] And then on the second trip,
[8683.10s - 8685.74s] Marco Polo went with him to China and back.
[8685.74s - 8687.38s] They were safe the whole way.
[8687.38s - 8688.46s] Their goods were safe.
[8688.46s - 8691.02s] They came back with tremendous amount of wealth.
[8691.02s - 8692.26s] They were never harassed.
[8692.26s - 8693.86s] And the mere fact that they could cross,
[8693.86s - 8695.10s] it took two years,
[8695.10s - 8698.66s] but the mere fact that they could cross the whole continent
[8698.66s - 8701.62s] safely and come back,
[8701.62s - 8703.18s] that was unprecedented.
[8703.18s - 8705.46s] We really don't have any well-documented case
[8705.86s - 8707.98s] of anybody safe from China visiting Europe
[8707.98s - 8710.94s] or Europe visiting China before the Mongols.
[8710.94s - 8712.34s] But since Genghis Khan,
[8712.34s - 8714.98s] there's never been a year without contact
[8714.98s - 8716.38s] between East and West.
[8716.38s - 8717.42s] It was permanent.
[8717.42s - 8719.90s] Once he created it, it was permanent.
[8719.90s - 8721.46s] I don't think it's possible to measure
[8721.46s - 8723.14s] the positive impact of that
[8723.14s - 8725.82s] because it wasn't just trade of goods.
[8725.82s - 8728.46s] It was also exchange,
[8728.46s - 8731.98s] explicit or implicit along the way, exchange of ideas,
[8731.98s - 8734.50s] whether that's exchange of technologies,
[8734.54s - 8737.62s] exchange of like philosophical ideas,
[8737.62s - 8739.30s] scientific ideas,
[8740.70s - 8742.34s] technical, mathematical ideas,
[8742.34s - 8747.06s] all of this spread throughout and constantly circulating.
[8748.94s - 8751.42s] Can you speak to that aspect of it?
[8751.42s - 8755.22s] Yes, it was exchange of ideas on every level,
[8755.22s - 8760.02s] ideas, technology, ideologies, beliefs,
[8760.02s - 8761.42s] scientific information,
[8761.42s - 8762.86s] everything was being exchanged
[8763.26s - 8767.14s] even agricultural goods of new crops for new areas.
[8767.14s - 8771.54s] But Genghis Khan, he had a part of his genius
[8771.54s - 8774.74s] of organization was knowing what skill people had
[8774.74s - 8776.90s] that would contribute towards his empire.
[8776.90s - 8780.50s] For example, the Muslims were very good with arithmetic.
[8780.50s - 8784.26s] In fact, he conquered the little empire of Khoresm
[8784.26s - 8787.06s] from which we get the word algorithm
[8787.06s - 8788.86s] because there was a mathematician there
[8788.86s - 8790.66s] who invented algorithms.
[8790.66s - 8793.62s] And so Khoresm, he conquered it very quickly,
[8793.62s - 8796.58s] very easily, no problem, but it belonged to him.
[8796.58s - 8800.34s] But the Muslims were using the zero.
[8800.34s - 8802.98s] The Mongols were absolutely impressed with that.
[8802.98s - 8804.02s] The Chinese less so,
[8804.02s - 8805.90s] they're very suspicious about the zero.
[8805.90s - 8807.78s] But the Mongols were very impressed
[8807.78s - 8811.90s] because herders' numbers are important to them
[8811.90s - 8813.66s] for keeping up with their animals.
[8814.74s - 8816.82s] In fact, the Mongols have a simple system.
[8816.82s - 8819.22s] They reduce all animals to the number of horses.
[8819.22s - 8821.74s] You can ask somebody how many animals you can have
[8821.74s - 8824.58s] and they can say, well, 100 horses.
[8824.58s - 8826.90s] And it doesn't mean they have 100 horses.
[8826.90s - 8831.90s] It's gonna be like five cows count as four horses,
[8834.02s - 8836.62s] five sheep or five goats count as one horse,
[8838.46s - 8841.22s] four camels count as five horses.
[8841.22s - 8843.18s] So they reduced it all down like that.
[8843.18s - 8845.42s] The Mongols take a census of everything.
[8845.42s - 8847.42s] And that's one of the first things Genghis Khan did.
[8847.46s - 8849.06s] And that was one of the demands he made
[8849.06s - 8850.74s] of every place he went,
[8850.74s - 8853.62s] is a complete census of your people.
[8853.62s - 8855.70s] And every house had to post outside,
[8855.70s - 8857.66s] how many people, how many animals,
[8857.66s - 8861.02s] what did they do, the occupations, all this information.
[8861.02s - 8864.82s] So they needed good mathematics for this.
[8864.82s - 8866.34s] The Muslims provided it.
[8866.34s - 8868.22s] So they took the Muslims to China,
[8868.22s - 8870.50s] these Middle Eastern scholars and all.
[8870.50s - 8873.50s] Unfortunately, they were rather ruthless sometimes
[8873.50s - 8876.38s] when it came to implementing the tax policies,
[8876.38s - 8879.74s] but they became the financial advisors to him.
[8881.54s - 8884.42s] Other groups of people had other roles like that
[8884.42s - 8887.54s] and he was moving them around constantly.
[8887.54s - 8890.22s] And so you had a combination.
[8890.22s - 8892.62s] As I said, he himself had that genius
[8892.62s - 8896.14s] for combining new bits of technology,
[8896.14s - 8899.30s] but it created a new kind of cultural spirit
[8899.30s - 8902.50s] in which other people were also combining technology
[8902.50s - 8905.22s] at other levels and being encouraged.
[8905.22s - 8908.02s] It was no longer heresy or the devil's work
[8908.02s - 8909.42s] to bring in this thing.
[8909.42s - 8912.06s] So we had the spread of printing, for example.
[8912.06s - 8913.82s] We had the partial spread of something
[8913.82s - 8917.54s] that's just print money, for example.
[8917.54s - 8920.78s] We had almanacs being created now through printing
[8920.78s - 8924.22s] that combined different calendars and different information
[8924.22s - 8925.54s] that was coming along.
[8925.54s - 8929.74s] But one simple but lethal form of technology
[8929.74s - 8932.06s] was that, for example, Chinese had gunpowder.
[8932.94s - 8937.34s] Mostly it was used for fireworks, religious things.
[8937.34s - 8939.10s] And then sometimes in warfare it was used
[8939.10s - 8941.02s] for a kind of primitive hand grenade
[8941.02s - 8943.98s] or a primitive bomb that could be thrown with a trebuchet.
[8943.98s - 8947.58s] And this is in the time of Kubla Khan more, the grandson.
[8947.58s - 8948.82s] So they had that.
[8948.82s - 8951.98s] The Middle Eastern, the Muslims and the Byzantines,
[8951.98s - 8956.98s] especially, they had naphtha, what we call Greek fire,
[8957.86s - 8960.66s] flamethrowers that could set things on fire.
[8961.62s - 8965.50s] The Europeans did not excel very much in technology.
[8965.50s - 8967.34s] They were behind in almost everything,
[8967.34s - 8970.78s] but they could cast bells for churches.
[8971.70s - 8973.62s] Okay, let's take that bell
[8973.62s - 8975.62s] and we're gonna turn it on its side.
[8977.06s - 8981.30s] We're gonna use some principles of the flamethrower
[8981.30s - 8984.66s] and we're gonna use the gunpowder from China
[8984.66s - 8985.82s] and you've got a cannon.
[8986.78s - 8988.62s] So the Mongols, even early on,
[8988.66s - 8990.78s] by the time they got to the siege of Baghdad,
[8990.78s - 8993.34s] but not, I think, in the lifetime of Chinggis Khan,
[8993.34s - 8996.90s] but soon thereafter in his sons and grandsons,
[8996.90s - 9000.34s] they were using some very primitive forms of cannon
[9001.22s - 9004.58s] and even something like firing rods.
[9004.58s - 9006.26s] We can't even call it anything like a rifle,
[9006.26s - 9010.78s] but it could fire a very small ballistic device at all.
[9010.78s - 9015.50s] So this combination of metal ergy, gunpowder,
[9015.50s - 9018.02s] flamethrowers, you put it all together
[9018.02s - 9021.90s] and you come up with something incredibly different.
[9021.90s - 9023.74s] So if we jump around a little bit,
[9023.74s - 9026.14s] sort of on the topic of a cannon,
[9026.14s - 9030.26s] what are some technological developments
[9030.26s - 9035.26s] that Chinggis Khan and his son and Kublai Khan were using?
[9036.06s - 9038.42s] So how much gunpowder were they using?
[9038.42s - 9039.90s] In general, what was their approach
[9039.90s - 9042.62s] to the siege warfare, for example?
[9042.62s - 9044.78s] What are some different ideas there?
[9044.78s - 9047.02s] If we switch to the grandson Kublai Khan,
[9048.58s - 9052.78s] he, first of all, he changed a lot of the strategies.
[9052.78s - 9053.86s] They were no longer working.
[9053.86s - 9056.82s] The Mongol system worked perfectly on the grassland,
[9056.82s - 9058.26s] but by the time you get to Hungary,
[9058.26s - 9060.02s] the grassland starts to give out.
[9060.02s - 9062.58s] By the time you get to Poland, it's so many farms,
[9062.58s - 9064.50s] it's hard for horses to get through the farms
[9064.50s - 9066.26s] and they don't wanna go on the roads.
[9066.26s - 9069.06s] By the time you get to the Indus River,
[9069.06s - 9072.54s] it's too hot, too humid, the bows are beginning to wilt,
[9072.54s - 9075.50s] the horses are exhausted, it's not working.
[9075.50s - 9077.18s] So to conquer South China,
[9077.18s - 9079.70s] Kublai Khan had to come up with new things.
[9080.94s - 9085.26s] One thing, the South Chinese had built a Great Wall.
[9085.26s - 9087.42s] It was called the Great Wall of the Sea.
[9087.42s - 9089.98s] This is before the wall that we know as the Great Wall,
[9089.98s - 9093.26s] which is really the Ming Wall of the Ming Dynasty was built.
[9093.26s - 9095.18s] But the Great Wall of the Sea,
[9095.18s - 9097.54s] and they used it as a defensive navy.
[9097.54s - 9100.30s] They had the largest navy in the world, it was defensive.
[9100.30s - 9102.62s] And it was most literally defensive
[9102.62s - 9105.14s] and that came time for warfare.
[9105.14s - 9106.90s] They would chain the ships together
[9106.90s - 9109.86s] across the mouth of a harbor to protect the city.
[9109.86s - 9112.34s] And so it became a wall.
[9112.34s - 9116.22s] So actually, if we rewind, Kublai Khan, who was he?
[9116.22s - 9120.18s] And what was the state of China at that time
[9120.18s - 9125.18s] that kind of sets up this idea of ships and siege warfare?
[9125.82s - 9128.34s] In 1215, Chinggis Khan conquered the city
[9128.34s - 9130.02s] we now know as Beijing.
[9130.02s - 9133.74s] It was the capital of the Jin Dynasty of Northern China.
[9133.74s - 9137.58s] At that time, Southern China was ruled by the Song Dynasty,
[9137.58s - 9139.34s] or usually called the Southern Song.
[9139.34s - 9142.18s] He had already conquered the Shixia Kingdom
[9142.18s - 9143.78s] or the Tangut people.
[9143.78s - 9147.82s] And so most of Northern China was under the control
[9147.82s - 9150.34s] of the Mongols from about 1215.
[9150.34s - 9152.26s] And then he conquered middle.
[9152.26s - 9155.26s] Later, his descendants conquered middle
[9155.26s - 9158.42s] and then Kublai Khan was the one to take on the South.
[9158.42s - 9160.98s] But Kublai Khan was born that year in 1215,
[9161.02s - 9164.98s] about three months after the capture of Beijing.
[9164.98s - 9166.42s] And he was nobody.
[9167.30s - 9171.70s] He was the second son of the fourth son of Chinggis Khan.
[9171.70s - 9174.38s] Well, he's got lots of cousins out there
[9174.38s - 9175.62s] who've been riding around.
[9175.62s - 9176.86s] They're conquering Russia
[9176.86s - 9179.38s] and they've already burned down Kiev
[9179.38s - 9181.90s] and they've conquered different places in the world.
[9181.90s - 9183.30s] They're real Mongols.
[9183.30s - 9184.90s] That's their whole life.
[9184.90s - 9187.22s] And he's born and he doesn't meet...
[9187.22s - 9189.26s] Chinggis Khan is about seven years old
[9189.34s - 9192.90s] and Chinggis Khan was away on conquest in Central Asia.
[9192.90s - 9196.54s] And Chinggis Khan came back and he met him and he said,
[9196.54s - 9199.70s] oh, he doesn't look like a Mongol.
[9199.70s - 9201.14s] He looks like his mother's people.
[9201.14s - 9203.02s] His mother was a Sorakhtani,
[9203.02s - 9205.02s] who was actually a part of the royal family
[9205.02s - 9206.46s] of the Merkit people,
[9206.46s - 9208.82s] whom he had conquered sometime earlier.
[9208.82s - 9211.26s] And so it looks like his mother's people
[9211.26s - 9212.58s] who was a little bit more tawny.
[9212.58s - 9214.10s] Mongols tend to be very white
[9214.10s - 9217.54s] with very bright red cheeks
[9217.58s - 9220.46s] and have a certain very round face and so on.
[9220.46s - 9223.50s] And so he looked different.
[9223.50s - 9225.10s] And for whatever reason,
[9225.10s - 9227.94s] his mother, I think she recognized the difference
[9227.94s - 9229.22s] and treated him differently.
[9229.22s - 9231.74s] Her oldest son was called Mung,
[9231.74s - 9233.82s] a later Mung Khan, Mung.
[9233.82s - 9235.30s] And she wanted him to become,
[9235.30s - 9239.38s] even though her husband was drunk,
[9239.38s - 9242.66s] who died out on campaign drunk.
[9242.66s - 9246.18s] And she took over Northern China
[9246.18s - 9247.70s] and she began to put it together
[9247.70s - 9250.46s] and she wanted her son to become the great Han,
[9250.46s - 9253.62s] the emperor of the Mongol Empire.
[9253.62s - 9254.78s] And this wasn't in line.
[9254.78s - 9255.90s] This wasn't gonna happen
[9255.90s - 9258.74s] because he's the fourth son out of three others
[9258.74s - 9261.46s] way in line, way ahead of her.
[9261.46s - 9263.14s] But she caused the revolution.
[9263.14s - 9264.26s] She made it happen.
[9264.26s - 9267.06s] She put her son in Mung Khan in 1251.
[9267.06s - 9268.58s] He became great Han.
[9269.82s - 9271.54s] He only lived till 1259.
[9271.54s - 9272.94s] He died of something.
[9272.94s - 9274.66s] It could have been cholera
[9274.66s - 9276.22s] or they're different stories
[9276.22s - 9277.90s] and I don't know the truth of it.
[9277.90s - 9280.02s] But he died on campaign in China,
[9280.02s - 9282.38s] trying to conquer Southern China.
[9282.38s - 9284.06s] Well, up to this point,
[9284.06s - 9287.18s] Kubla Khan had not been distinguishing himself.
[9287.18s - 9290.30s] His mother was, she was a Christian woman,
[9290.30s - 9293.14s] but she had a Buddhist nurse for him.
[9293.14s - 9296.38s] And she had Chinese scholars come in to tutor him.
[9296.38s - 9298.94s] She had a very good education for him.
[9299.86s - 9301.34s] And I think that she planned
[9301.34s - 9303.22s] that he was gonna be a great administrator
[9303.22s - 9304.90s] under his older brother
[9304.90s - 9307.10s] and he was gonna administer the lands in China.
[9307.10s - 9309.54s] And so he was learning all this stuff for it.
[9309.54s - 9310.86s] But the older brother,
[9310.86s - 9313.26s] he insisted on sending him out on campaign.
[9313.26s - 9314.90s] Oh, but he was overweight.
[9314.90s - 9315.74s] He was fat.
[9315.74s - 9316.86s] He had gout.
[9316.86s - 9318.10s] He needed to go rest.
[9318.10s - 9319.98s] There was always some excuse.
[9319.98s - 9321.74s] And the brother was assigning people,
[9321.74s - 9325.26s] Orihang Dai, who was the son of Subodai, the great general.
[9325.26s - 9327.42s] He assigned him to teach him warfare.
[9328.70s - 9330.70s] He wasn't great on the battlefield.
[9330.70s - 9331.58s] He really was not.
[9331.58s - 9334.22s] But he was very smart.
[9335.22s - 9336.62s] And at first a little bit lazy,
[9336.62s - 9338.06s] like talking about the religion,
[9338.06s - 9340.10s] sitting around, go hunting,
[9340.10s - 9342.94s] as long as he had many with him to do the shooting
[9342.94s - 9345.66s] and then to prepare the food and all.
[9346.82s - 9350.54s] And his territory in Northern China
[9350.54s - 9354.62s] was just being run in the dirt by these administrators
[9354.62s - 9356.22s] the Mongols had brought in.
[9356.22s - 9357.86s] They were just overtaxing the people,
[9357.86s - 9360.18s] cheating the people, doing everything wrong.
[9360.18s - 9362.82s] And his mother basically just pulled his chain
[9362.82s - 9364.98s] and she said, go to your land.
[9364.98s - 9365.82s] This is your land.
[9365.82s - 9367.38s] You have to administer this land.
[9367.38s - 9368.22s] You go there.
[9368.22s - 9369.06s] You live there.
[9369.06s - 9370.98s] You take charge.
[9370.98s - 9373.70s] And everybody was terrified of the mother.
[9373.70s - 9376.02s] And so he ran off to China
[9376.02s - 9377.58s] and he started administering his land
[9377.58s - 9379.30s] and he started learning how to do it.
[9379.30s - 9381.74s] Well, when his brother died in 1259,
[9381.74s - 9384.34s] he was down on the Yangtze River
[9385.30s - 9387.54s] on a campaign that he was sent by his brother.
[9387.54s - 9389.70s] He was having no success at all.
[9389.70s - 9391.30s] But he thought, okay, the brother's dead.
[9391.30s - 9393.42s] I should finish the campaign.
[9393.42s - 9396.02s] Meanwhile, his youngest brother, Arihbukh,
[9396.02s - 9398.26s] Arihbukh was another hot-headed Mongol
[9398.26s - 9399.90s] like their father, Tulu.
[9399.90s - 9403.54s] He was rather hot-headed and he was back in Mongolia
[9403.54s - 9405.74s] and his tolerance for religions,
[9405.74s - 9408.10s] he had to oversee the debate one time
[9408.10s - 9409.50s] between the Taoists and the Buddhists
[9409.50s - 9411.70s] because the Mongols thought the Taoists
[9411.70s - 9413.94s] were overtaxing everybody, the Buddhists.
[9413.94s - 9415.78s] And so he had to oversee it.
[9415.78s - 9418.10s] He got mad and he picked up a statue of the Buddha
[9418.10s - 9420.86s] and beat the Taoist representative to death.
[9420.86s - 9424.70s] So he just wasn't good for moderating debates.
[9425.94s - 9429.78s] So he was going to be the new Great Khan.
[9429.78s - 9432.58s] So he was declared the Great Khan in Mongolia
[9434.06s - 9436.42s] but this was the turning light for Kubla Khan
[9436.42s - 9438.50s] who had never achieved much of anything
[9438.50s - 9440.46s] other than talking to people.
[9440.46s - 9445.30s] So his wife, Chaby, sent him some coded messages,
[9445.30s - 9449.54s] basically telling him, forget about Southern China.
[9449.54s - 9450.78s] It's gonna always be there.
[9450.78s - 9452.54s] You can conquer that some other time.
[9452.54s - 9455.86s] Right now, your brother is taking over the empire.
[9455.86s - 9457.94s] You should be the new emperor.
[9457.94s - 9461.58s] You are the next son after Meng Khan.
[9463.06s - 9466.34s] And somehow she invigorated him and he came back
[9466.34s - 9468.66s] and even though he didn't have all the military strategy,
[9468.66s - 9471.98s] he had Northern China, the resources were immense.
[9471.98s - 9473.34s] He could cut off Mongolia.
[9473.34s - 9478.06s] Mongolia was very dependent on Northern China for food.
[9478.06s - 9480.30s] All the Mongols supported Arik Bok.
[9480.30s - 9482.26s] All the ones in Central Asia,
[9482.26s - 9484.46s] all of them were supporting Arik Bok.
[9484.46s - 9487.62s] And so he went to get food from them
[9489.02s - 9491.14s] and then they didn't wanna give up their food.
[9491.14s - 9493.34s] Yeah, we wanna support you for Great Khan
[9493.34s - 9495.46s] but we're not giving up our food.
[9495.46s - 9500.42s] So he was basically kind of starved into submission in 1262
[9500.42s - 9503.10s] and then he was taken prisoner into China
[9503.10s - 9508.10s] and then he mysteriously passed away in 1264
[9510.22s - 9514.54s] while a legal case was being brought against him for trial
[9514.54s - 9517.02s] but he never made it to trial.
[9517.02s - 9518.30s] He was gone.
[9518.30s - 9523.30s] So Kubla Khan not really distinguished himself very much
[9523.94s - 9527.82s] but he didn't have the genius of his grandfather.
[9527.82s - 9530.42s] I won't say that but he was smart and clever.
[9530.42s - 9534.42s] He understood more about China than most Mongols did
[9534.42s - 9537.82s] and he understood more about Mongols than most Chinese did.
[9539.34s - 9541.30s] So the great thing left the Chinggis Khan
[9541.30s - 9546.30s] said on his deathbed, finish conquering China.
[9546.46s - 9548.22s] That was the great objective.
[9548.22s - 9552.58s] So Kublai was going to fulfill this
[9552.58s - 9555.62s] and they didn't know how the great wall of ships
[9555.62s - 9557.82s] was protecting the Southern Song.
[9557.82s - 9560.22s] This huge Yangtze River was so bad
[9560.98s - 9563.34s] the ocean on the side, all of these things
[9563.34s - 9564.98s] were protecting them.
[9565.86s - 9570.22s] So he had one of his very smart generals named Aju
[9570.22s - 9571.78s] who was a real Mongol
[9571.78s - 9573.94s] but he was also able to think in innovative way.
[9573.94s - 9575.54s] He was the grandson of Subadai
[9576.58s - 9580.02s] and he went with his father Urihanggadai
[9580.02s - 9583.86s] on the conquest of the Red River of Northern Vietnam
[9583.86s - 9585.34s] against the Dai Viet people.
[9587.14s - 9588.86s] They went down the river.
[9588.86s - 9592.42s] They were trying to surround the Chinese territory.
[9592.42s - 9593.86s] They were gonna hit them from the north,
[9593.86s - 9595.42s] from the west and from the south.
[9595.42s - 9599.38s] So they went down the Red River to conquer the Dai Viet.
[9599.38s - 9602.90s] The Dai Viet moved their army up on the other side by boat
[9602.90s - 9605.58s] and then they had a whole core of elephants.
[9605.58s - 9606.74s] So they had the Mongols on one side,
[9606.74s - 9610.78s] the river and the Dai Viet forces on the other side.
[9610.78s - 9615.02s] Urihanggadai was a smart man, not a genius but smart
[9615.02s - 9617.42s] and he already knew from campaigns in Burma
[9617.42s - 9619.78s] that the only way to route the elephants
[9619.78s - 9622.54s] was with flaming arrows to the feet.
[9622.54s - 9623.70s] That was it.
[9623.70s - 9626.98s] But he recognized that they came up on boats.
[9626.98s - 9628.90s] Mongols didn't like boats.
[9628.90s - 9631.62s] It just, they crossed the river on a goat skin.
[9631.62s - 9633.10s] They wanted to do something organic.
[9633.10s - 9634.66s] A boat was like a cart.
[9634.66s - 9636.10s] A cart belonged to a woman.
[9636.10s - 9637.34s] It was a floating cart.
[9637.34s - 9639.70s] I am not going over on a floating cart.
[9639.70s - 9642.94s] I'm gonna ride a goat skin across the river.
[9643.94s - 9646.94s] So he's assigned one detachment.
[9646.94s - 9648.58s] You have to burn the boats
[9648.58s - 9653.58s] so the Dai Viet cannot escape when we route the elephants.
[9653.94s - 9656.90s] Well, the war battle, I mean, got started.
[9656.90s - 9658.62s] The elephants are running wild.
[9658.62s - 9660.26s] All kinds of chaos is going on.
[9661.66s - 9665.26s] The group that sent to burn the boats, they're Mongols.
[9665.26s - 9666.78s] They wanna go to war.
[9666.78s - 9668.42s] Why burn a bunch of women's carts?
[9668.42s - 9670.22s] It's just not, you know, floating.
[9670.22s - 9671.46s] So they go and join the battle.
[9671.46s - 9672.62s] They leave the boats.
[9672.94s - 9674.82s] Well, the Mongols won the battle,
[9674.82s - 9676.86s] but the Dai Viet forces got on the boats
[9676.86s - 9679.22s] and sailed back to what's now Hanoi.
[9679.22s - 9680.74s] And then they evacuated the city,
[9680.74s - 9682.86s] took all the food, everything out of the city,
[9682.86s - 9685.34s] and they disappeared into the Delta.
[9685.34s - 9686.22s] The Mongols arrived.
[9686.22s - 9690.58s] They conquered, quote unquote, Hanoi, the capital city.
[9690.58s - 9692.90s] And they had nothing.
[9692.90s - 9693.78s] They had nothing.
[9694.78s - 9695.74s] They won every battle.
[9695.74s - 9697.06s] They lost the war.
[9697.06s - 9698.22s] They retreated.
[9698.22s - 9701.82s] Adju was the son of Hengadai,
[9702.02s - 9703.62s] and he saw all this happen.
[9703.62s - 9707.78s] And he recognized the importance of water and boats.
[9707.78s - 9709.34s] And so he knew.
[9709.34s - 9712.42s] And he spent his time studying the Yangtze River
[9712.42s - 9715.34s] and every little river around it and the cities.
[9715.34s - 9717.98s] And the crucial thing he saw was the cities
[9717.98s - 9721.98s] are heavily, heavily fortified on the land side
[9721.98s - 9723.70s] because invasion comes from the land,
[9723.70s - 9725.78s] and they expect this little line of boats
[9725.78s - 9727.58s] to protect them on the water.
[9727.58s - 9729.78s] And so the city walls are weak.
[9729.82s - 9731.90s] The defenses are weak on that side.
[9731.90s - 9733.62s] That's where we have to attack.
[9733.62s - 9734.98s] So how?
[9734.98s - 9738.02s] They sent off to the Ilkhanate, to Persia,
[9738.02s - 9740.70s] where Chinggis Khan, his uncle, was now dead
[9740.70s - 9742.70s] and his cousins were ruling there,
[9742.70s - 9745.02s] or his nephews, we would say, or cousins' nephews.
[9745.02s - 9749.02s] So they sent over engineers
[9749.02s - 9752.86s] to build a special kind of trebuchet, a catapult.
[9752.86s - 9755.58s] And they had to play around with it to adapt it for a boat
[9755.58s - 9757.78s] because they were usually made for stable ground,
[9757.78s - 9759.30s] but they adapted it for the boat
[9759.30s - 9761.30s] and for throwing heavy things,
[9761.30s - 9764.74s] and also for some incendiary bombs.
[9764.74s - 9769.62s] They developed it, they attacked the first city, it fell.
[9769.62s - 9771.06s] They attacked the next, it fell.
[9771.06s - 9772.82s] They had something that was working.
[9772.82s - 9776.14s] They worked their way down the Yangtze River,
[9776.14s - 9779.18s] destroying city after city with this navy.
[9779.18s - 9780.98s] And then the army would move in
[9780.98s - 9782.70s] after the navy had broken down.
[9782.70s - 9786.06s] So this is a catapult on a ship.
[9786.06s - 9787.22s] Catapult on a ship.
[9787.26s - 9788.74s] But it's, yeah, we call it trebuchet
[9788.74s - 9790.34s] for this type of catapult.
[9790.34s - 9792.50s] So this is an engineering solution
[9793.42s - 9797.54s] for peoples who are deeply uncomfortable with boats.
[9797.54s - 9798.38s] Yes.
[9798.38s - 9799.50s] And they've accepted it.
[9799.50s - 9800.34s] Yes.
[9800.34s - 9802.10s] Now it's a great weapon.
[9802.10s - 9804.98s] It's like it's not, it's no longer a woman's cart.
[9804.98s - 9806.26s] It's a bow and arrow.
[9806.26s - 9808.46s] It is a giant bow and arrow.
[9808.46s - 9809.30s] Yeah, it's fascinating.
[9809.30s - 9812.18s] So they go, they hit them hard on the walls
[9812.18s - 9815.78s] on the weak side where there's no, the army protection.
[9815.78s - 9816.86s] Yes.
[9816.90s - 9821.30s] And they conquer their way down to Hangzhou,
[9821.30s - 9823.22s] the capital of the Southern Song.
[9824.74s - 9826.38s] They've been in power for a long time,
[9826.38s - 9831.18s] since 970, and now we're already into the 1270s.
[9831.18s - 9832.90s] That's a long time.
[9832.90s - 9834.06s] They are dissipated.
[9834.06s - 9837.26s] They've been had child, they've had imbeciles ruling,
[9837.26s - 9839.18s] all kinds of things going on.
[9839.18s - 9842.86s] And at this point, we have a child in command.
[9843.86s - 9847.94s] But Kublai makes a very strange move.
[9848.86s - 9851.22s] He says, okay, let's invade Japan now.
[9854.26s - 9855.50s] They're like, what?
[9855.50s - 9856.34s] Wait, wait, wait.
[9856.34s - 9858.74s] We're fighting against the Song dynasty.
[9858.74s - 9861.30s] And most people ascribe it to all kinds of things,
[9861.30s - 9864.10s] but actually I think there was a great logic to it.
[9864.10s - 9867.46s] One was he had abolished his grandfather's policy
[9867.46s - 9870.66s] of defeat and destroy until they are no more.
[9870.66s - 9874.02s] That was the phrase that was used for their enemies.
[9874.02s - 9876.94s] And he had replaced it with a kind of mercy policy.
[9876.94s - 9879.66s] Try to incorporate them into your army if possible,
[9879.66s - 9880.94s] but be merciful.
[9880.94s - 9883.30s] He did not want to destroy, and he was not.
[9883.30s - 9885.98s] He had a lot of defectors coming in.
[9885.98s - 9889.22s] And because the Mongols prized people with skills,
[9889.22s - 9892.22s] a lot of very clever people with shipbuilding
[9892.22s - 9894.98s] and engineers and these people were flocking
[9894.98s - 9899.42s] to the Mongols, whereas the scholars were all hanging out
[9899.42s - 9903.34s] in Guangzhou, doing calligraphy and poetry
[9903.34s - 9906.06s] and having contests over who could sing or paint.
[9906.06s - 9911.06s] Or I don't know what scholars do, but they were being scholars.
[9911.86s - 9914.22s] But they're actually, I think there's a very,
[9914.22s - 9918.42s] very good reason for invading Japan, several.
[9918.42s - 9922.38s] The main one was to cut off the supply of sulfur.
[9922.38s - 9925.30s] They needed it for gunpowder in the South Song.
[9925.30s - 9927.30s] They lost their sources in Northern China
[9927.30s - 9928.58s] when they were driven out.
[9928.58s - 9930.26s] They got it from Japan.
[9930.26s - 9931.70s] It was a great source.
[9931.70s - 9933.58s] But I think there were other reasons.
[9933.58s - 9937.86s] If they could trade, they could also perhaps flee to Japan.
[9937.86s - 9940.02s] And they didn't want that to happen.
[9940.02s - 9941.62s] And then there's this idea of, you know,
[9941.62s - 9944.46s] like kill the chicken to scare the monkey.
[9944.46s - 9946.02s] It's like, okay, we'll go do this.
[9946.02s - 9948.38s] And then maybe they'll just surrender down there
[9948.38s - 9950.06s] if they see us conquer Japan.
[9950.06s - 9951.90s] Well, it was a total failure.
[9951.90s - 9954.82s] You've got a bunch of ships that are mainly great
[9954.82s - 9957.38s] on the river and will ride along the coast.
[9957.42s - 9960.10s] And you're crossing some treacherous water there.
[9960.10s - 9964.06s] And the Mongols basically just did not know
[9964.06s - 9964.98s] what they were doing.
[9964.98s - 9966.70s] Okay, you can arrive with the trebuchet
[9966.70s - 9969.34s] and you can throw grenades at the beach.
[9969.34s - 9971.18s] It's not really gonna do a lot of damage.
[9971.18s - 9973.02s] It might scare a few horses,
[9973.02s - 9974.94s] but you're not destroying cities.
[9974.94s - 9977.22s] And the Japanese cities were more in.
[9977.22s - 9978.62s] They weren't there on the beach waiting
[9978.62s - 9980.70s] for Mongols to come invade.
[9980.70s - 9982.66s] So he failed in that invasion.
[9982.66s - 9986.94s] So we should say that this is the time of samurai, right?
[9987.50s - 9988.34s] In Japan.
[9988.34s - 9992.50s] So there was never a real test of like battle.
[9992.50s - 9993.90s] No, there was some fighting
[9993.90s - 9996.62s] and the samurai learned some very valuable things.
[9996.62s - 9999.66s] The samurai had such a ritualized way of,
[9999.66s - 10002.54s] it's like the Knights of Europe coming out with armor
[10002.54s - 10005.14s] that had to be lifted up on a crane onto a horse.
[10005.14s - 10007.98s] And I mean, it was just craziness, craziness.
[10007.98s - 10010.02s] The samurai almost at that point,
[10010.02s - 10011.58s] you ride out in front of your enemy
[10011.58s - 10014.46s] and you recite the story of your genealogy.
[10014.82s - 10015.66s] All right.
[10015.66s - 10017.50s] Oh, what?
[10017.50s - 10019.94s] You know, Mongols, they have no use for that.
[10019.94s - 10020.78s] They're there to fight.
[10020.78s - 10021.90s] They're there to win.
[10021.90s - 10023.14s] But on the other hand,
[10023.14s - 10025.98s] this was an unknown territory to them
[10025.98s - 10027.58s] and the weather did turn against them.
[10027.58s - 10031.42s] But I don't want to give too much credit to the weather.
[10031.42s - 10034.26s] I really think that the Japanese defeated them.
[10034.26s - 10036.34s] The Mongols weren't well-prepared.
[10036.34s - 10038.26s] Their ships were not very good.
[10038.26s - 10040.50s] They were defeated in the first invasion.
[10040.50s - 10043.18s] Could they get off the ships onto the beach?
[10043.18s - 10044.02s] Yeah, they did.
[10044.02s - 10046.30s] They had some skirmishes or small battles on land.
[10046.30s - 10047.34s] Yes, they did.
[10047.34s - 10050.22s] But they didn't successfully complete them.
[10050.22s - 10051.18s] No, no.
[10051.18s - 10053.58s] So they couldn't do their usual Mongol thing.
[10053.58s - 10054.42s] You're right.
[10054.42s - 10056.22s] Well, see, they don't have enough horses for one thing.
[10056.22s - 10057.18s] Yeah.
[10057.18s - 10060.82s] And there were many tactical things
[10060.82s - 10062.22s] that they had done incorrectly.
[10062.22s - 10063.74s] It's the first time anybody had ever tried
[10063.74s - 10066.06s] to have such a massive invasion.
[10066.06s - 10066.90s] Yeah.
[10066.90s - 10068.22s] So they're just learning the basics
[10068.22s - 10070.14s] of what it means to have a navy.
[10070.14s - 10072.62s] So he has failed to conquer
[10072.66s - 10073.70s] and he's thinking like a Mongol
[10073.70s - 10077.06s] that you rule those waters and lands,
[10077.06s - 10080.18s] but he ruled the ocean.
[10080.18s - 10081.50s] He stopped the trade.
[10081.50s - 10083.42s] He stopped the supply.
[10083.42s - 10085.50s] He cut off the possibility
[10085.50s - 10087.90s] of the Song dynasty fleeing to Japan.
[10088.78s - 10090.62s] He won in a certain way.
[10090.62s - 10093.70s] He lost, but he had won his objective
[10093.70s - 10096.26s] of cutting off Southern China.
[10096.26s - 10101.10s] Also, it gave him navy some experience with the ocean.
[10101.10s - 10102.70s] And now they were ready to move out
[10102.70s - 10105.26s] into the ocean around Southern China.
[10106.26s - 10107.86s] So they were closing in then.
[10108.86s - 10110.38s] Aji was in command,
[10110.38s - 10113.86s] but actually the head command was a man named Bayan,
[10113.86s - 10117.50s] who was a Mongol who had been raised more in Central Asia.
[10117.50s - 10121.94s] He was perhaps born close to the Fagana Valley in that area.
[10121.94s - 10123.46s] We're not exactly sure where he was born,
[10123.46s - 10125.10s] but he grew up over there.
[10125.10s - 10129.30s] And then he eventually was living in what's now Iran.
[10129.30s - 10132.86s] But he came and he took over command of the army.
[10132.86s - 10137.18s] He was very cosmopolitan, sophisticated, intelligent.
[10137.18s - 10139.74s] Aji should have been in command,
[10139.74s - 10141.30s] but Bayan recognized that
[10141.30s - 10144.02s] and he and Aji worked together very well.
[10144.02s - 10147.50s] Aji knew how to fight the war.
[10147.50s - 10149.94s] Bayan was able to negotiate things back
[10149.94s - 10151.98s] with the capital city and handle things.
[10151.98s - 10154.18s] So Bayan is in command.
[10154.18s - 10157.02s] And so the generals are deserting the South Song
[10157.02s - 10158.30s] right and left.
[10158.30s - 10160.22s] The artisans are all coming up to join them.
[10160.22s - 10161.78s] Mongols get paid.
[10161.78s - 10165.70s] The generals are loading up the boats with all the jewels
[10165.70s - 10168.62s] and they grab a couple of brothers
[10168.62s - 10170.98s] to the little five-year-old emperor
[10170.98s - 10172.66s] and they put them on a boat and they're fleeing.
[10172.66s - 10175.34s] They even deserted their own families.
[10175.34s - 10180.34s] The generals were corrupt cowards who fled.
[10180.42s - 10184.42s] The person left in charge was the Dowager Empress,
[10184.42s - 10186.70s] an old lady, she had no children.
[10186.74s - 10190.66s] Xie was her name, the Dowager Empress Xie.
[10190.66s - 10192.94s] They said she was missing an eye.
[10193.78s - 10194.62s] She was ugly.
[10194.62s - 10196.02s] They called her ugly Xie.
[10196.02s - 10198.10s] That's what they called her at that time.
[10198.94s - 10200.78s] She was in charge
[10200.78s - 10202.58s] and she offered the Mongols everything.
[10202.58s - 10203.62s] I'll give you everything.
[10203.62s - 10205.22s] Please let the Empress stay.
[10205.22s - 10207.70s] Okay, even if you demote him to just being a king,
[10207.70s - 10208.94s] please let him stay.
[10208.94s - 10213.38s] Bayan said no, total surrender, total surrender.
[10213.38s - 10215.82s] So she decided to surrender.
[10215.82s - 10218.78s] Once he said, yes, we will surrender the capital.
[10218.78s - 10221.30s] So Bayan came in with a small group of soldiers.
[10221.30s - 10223.38s] They looked around and she invited him
[10223.38s - 10226.66s] to come to the palace to surrender.
[10226.66s - 10230.98s] And he said, no, I didn't win this war in the palace.
[10230.98s - 10233.78s] My soldiers won this war in the field.
[10233.78s - 10235.98s] You have to come with the emperor
[10235.98s - 10239.10s] in front of my soldiers to surrender.
[10239.10s - 10240.26s] But he did not harm her.
[10240.26s - 10243.66s] He respected her and there was no looting of the city.
[10244.66s - 10248.62s] Now later, they take everything in a very systematic way.
[10248.62s - 10251.90s] They take the archives and all this kind of stuff away.
[10251.90s - 10254.22s] But there was no wholesale looting and killing of people.
[10254.22s - 10255.18s] Nothing like that.
[10256.18s - 10261.14s] So they've taken the capital and she comes out.
[10261.14s - 10262.06s] She surrenders.
[10262.06s - 10264.78s] She bows on the ground towards Beijing.
[10264.78s - 10267.18s] And then she takes the child emperor
[10267.18s - 10270.26s] and they slowly make their way.
[10270.26s - 10271.34s] She was a little bit sick.
[10271.34s - 10273.38s] It took her a longer time to Beijing.
[10273.38s - 10275.78s] And they surrender again in a public ceremony
[10275.78s - 10277.46s] bowing to the Kublai Khan.
[10277.46s - 10279.30s] He gives each of them a palace.
[10279.30s - 10284.30s] He gives them a new title.
[10284.34s - 10285.86s] He's trying to show the world
[10285.86s - 10288.10s] this is the new face of Mongols.
[10288.10s - 10290.82s] We don't kill off the old people anymore who are ruling.
[10290.82s - 10293.82s] We're gonna give them a palace, treat them nicely and all.
[10295.34s - 10299.62s] But the navy that had fled did not defend the city.
[10299.66s - 10302.54s] Those cowardly generals,
[10303.62s - 10307.30s] they made the new little boy, seven year old brother,
[10307.30s - 10311.26s] half brother to the emperor Gong was his name.
[10311.26s - 10312.58s] They made him the emperor.
[10314.54s - 10318.22s] Well, they're just floating around on the ocean
[10318.22s - 10323.22s] losing all support from city after city.
[10323.98s - 10327.02s] The Muslims who were controlling the trade
[10327.02s - 10329.82s] and controlling many of the ships of that area,
[10329.82s - 10332.62s] they were Chinese Muslims, but they were still Muslims.
[10333.78s - 10335.66s] They switched sides to the Mongols
[10335.66s - 10337.58s] because of the religious freedom thing.
[10337.58s - 10338.94s] And because they were merchants
[10338.94s - 10340.94s] and their status would be raised.
[10340.94s - 10344.46s] So the Muslims were switching over.
[10344.46s - 10346.66s] The fleet was kind of a fleet lost
[10346.66s - 10348.30s] without a country out there.
[10348.30s - 10350.82s] They had some loyal supporters some places.
[10353.50s - 10355.66s] They dropped the emperor in the ocean.
[10356.66s - 10359.78s] How do you drop the emperor into ocean?
[10359.78s - 10362.02s] They accidentally spilled him into ocean
[10362.02s - 10365.14s] and then they fished him out, but he died.
[10365.14s - 10368.98s] So fortunately they had one more seven year old half brother.
[10368.98s - 10370.30s] So on Lantau Island,
[10370.30s - 10373.86s] exactly where the Hong Kong airport is today,
[10373.86s - 10375.90s] the new, well, it's not so new anymore,
[10375.90s - 10378.94s] but I still think it was the new airport on Lantau Island.
[10379.98s - 10383.46s] So they went there and they had a big coronation ceremony
[10384.14s - 10386.46s] but the people there were not supportive enough.
[10386.46s - 10389.18s] It certainly wasn't Hong Kong then anyway,
[10389.18s - 10391.70s] the Delta, the Pearl River.
[10391.70s - 10395.42s] So they sailed out farther south to another island.
[10395.42s - 10396.90s] And then they took it over.
[10396.90s - 10398.38s] And of course, the first thing they did was,
[10398.38s - 10399.98s] well, we have to build a palace.
[10401.38s - 10402.22s] What?
[10402.22s - 10403.14s] The Mongols are chasing you
[10403.14s - 10405.30s] and you're gonna stop and build a palace?
[10405.30s - 10408.06s] So these are like the remains of the Chinese.
[10408.06s - 10411.06s] Yes, the generals and the army and the Navy.
[10411.06s - 10413.22s] And that was a real competence issue.
[10414.14s - 10415.54s] Okay.
[10415.54s - 10416.38s] So they're gonna build a palace.
[10416.38s - 10419.38s] We're gonna protect it with a great wall of the sea.
[10419.38s - 10421.82s] They chained together the boats across them
[10421.82s - 10423.94s] into the harbor.
[10423.94s - 10427.02s] And they put the palace boat so-called in the middle.
[10428.74s - 10432.06s] The generals didn't trust their own soldiers enough.
[10432.06s - 10433.94s] So they made all of them leave the island
[10433.94s - 10436.70s] and go to the boats to fight the Mongols.
[10436.70s - 10439.10s] So Mongols arrived in over and over and over.
[10439.10s - 10441.26s] They asked them to surrender.
[10441.26s - 10443.98s] You won't be harmed, all this kind of stuff.
[10444.98s - 10447.30s] But the Mongols now took over the land.
[10447.30s - 10450.26s] So they had the water all around them and they had the land.
[10451.18s - 10453.94s] And once the fighting started,
[10453.94s - 10455.70s] they could just shoot down from the highland
[10455.70s - 10457.10s] right onto the ships.
[10457.10s - 10458.82s] And they've cut the ships off
[10458.82s - 10462.26s] from the fresh supply of wood and water.
[10462.26s - 10463.82s] So they can't boil rice.
[10463.82s - 10466.38s] They have to try to eat rice and drink sea water.
[10466.38s - 10468.70s] They're all sick as dogs out there.
[10468.70s - 10473.70s] And the leaders refused to surrender.
[10473.82s - 10476.86s] The little boy is there, seven-year-old emperor,
[10476.86s - 10480.50s] Bing was his name, with his pet parrot.
[10480.50s - 10482.54s] That's the only thing he had left in life
[10482.54s - 10483.78s] was his pet parrot.
[10484.90s - 10488.50s] And then the Mongols, they offered every opportunity,
[10489.50s - 10493.66s] but the prime minister so-called,
[10493.66s - 10496.34s] coward that he is, although he's treated as a hero today
[10496.34s - 10498.54s] in China and throughout their history.
[10499.38s - 10501.82s] The coward that he was, he said,
[10501.82s - 10503.90s] we will not disgrace the country
[10503.90s - 10506.10s] by letting them capture the emperor.
[10506.10s - 10508.34s] So first he threw his own wife and children
[10508.34s - 10509.86s] into the water to drown.
[10510.94s - 10515.02s] And then he took the emperor and held him,
[10515.02s - 10517.50s] the seven-year-old, he was seven years and one month.
[10517.50s - 10519.70s] He had just turned seven years old
[10519.70s - 10522.06s] and jumped into the water with his child.
[10523.06s - 10526.90s] A child murderer, he's a child murderer to do that.
[10526.90s - 10529.10s] Somehow in the whole ruckus,
[10529.10s - 10531.46s] the cage came undone with the parrot
[10531.46s - 10534.06s] and the parrot fell in the water too.
[10534.06s - 10539.06s] So the seven-year-old boy and the parrot died in the water.
[10539.46s - 10542.10s] That was the end of one of the greatest dynasties
[10542.10s - 10544.26s] in the history of the world.
[10544.26s - 10547.62s] The Song dynasty, they were intellectually great,
[10547.62s - 10549.46s] they were artistically great,
[10549.46s - 10551.30s] they were technologically great.
[10551.30s - 10553.38s] They were just one of the greatest moments
[10553.38s - 10554.90s] of world history.
[10554.94s - 10558.34s] And it ends with this coward killing a child
[10558.34s - 10562.02s] and his pet parrot in order to save the honor
[10562.02s - 10564.06s] that was betrayed by this woman.
[10564.06s - 10567.14s] The men lost the war, the men lost the war.
[10567.14s - 10568.74s] Who's to blame?
[10568.74s - 10573.02s] An old, one-eyed, ugly lady, Empress Xiye.
[10573.02s - 10576.22s] Well, the bigger picture there is probably is become,
[10576.22s - 10578.70s] the institutions became corrupt and stale
[10578.70s - 10583.70s] and the army weakened and the politician class
[10584.70s - 10589.18s] probably have lost their skill and competence
[10589.18s - 10590.94s] at ruling and all that kind of stuff.
[10590.94s - 10593.38s] All that is true and the Chinese summarize that
[10593.38s - 10595.22s] with losing the mandate of heaven.
[10595.22s - 10598.78s] Right, I mean, everybody has their perspective maybe.
[10598.78s - 10603.78s] If the way you told the story has a very kind of objective
[10607.30s - 10610.38s] sort of way of revealing the absurdity
[10610.38s - 10611.78s] and the cowardice of it,
[10611.82s - 10614.10s] but there's probably the Chinese perspective
[10614.10s - 10617.78s] that they tell the story in some kind of maintained honor
[10617.78s - 10620.38s] to the last moment.
[10620.38s - 10624.62s] They very often, most scholars depict Empress Xiye
[10624.62s - 10626.22s] as the traitor to the country.
[10627.18s - 10631.50s] And I say, no, that boy lived on for another 45 years.
[10633.74s - 10636.02s] And so she did not betray the country.
[10636.02s - 10639.38s] She protected her emperor that she was supposed to protect.
[10639.38s - 10642.50s] It was the man who killed the child emperor
[10642.50s - 10643.90s] who killed Yang Bing.
[10644.78s - 10648.82s] So what was the lasting impact of Kublai Khan
[10648.82s - 10650.86s] unifying China?
[10650.86s - 10653.46s] Well, yes, first of all, he had unified China
[10653.46s - 10656.06s] in the largest sense of the word with Korea,
[10656.06s - 10660.18s] Tibet, Manchuria, Mongolia, part of Central Asia.
[10660.18s - 10661.70s] He had unified it,
[10661.70s - 10665.22s] but he did so at the expense of his empire.
[10665.22s - 10667.50s] They didn't recognize him as the great emperor
[10667.50s - 10669.66s] and there was great opposition
[10669.66s - 10671.66s] from the golden horde of Russia
[10671.66s - 10674.02s] and also from the central region,
[10674.02s - 10675.90s] which is called the Chagatai,
[10675.90s - 10678.74s] the descendants of Sagade, the second son,
[10678.74s - 10680.42s] the Chagatai empire,
[10680.42s - 10683.18s] and then from the Ilkhanate of Persia.
[10683.18s - 10685.98s] These are the different sort of fracturings
[10685.98s - 10686.82s] of the Mongol empire.
[10686.82s - 10688.38s] The sons of Genghis Khan.
[10688.38s - 10692.18s] And only the Ilkhanate was still loyal to him,
[10692.18s - 10694.50s] but they're so far away,
[10694.50s - 10695.90s] but now he has a navy.
[10695.90s - 10698.90s] But this is, I mean, even the four pieces,
[10698.90s - 10700.42s] the whole thing is gigantic
[10700.42s - 10702.70s] and even the pieces are gigantic.
[10702.70s - 10705.58s] So, I mean, it's very hard
[10705.58s - 10707.58s] to keep an empire of this size together.
[10707.58s - 10711.06s] Yes, but he had China, it was unified under him
[10712.34s - 10716.10s] and then he sent out the first expedition
[10716.10s - 10719.22s] to sail directly to Persia.
[10719.22s - 10722.54s] There had been trade all throughout thousands of years,
[10722.54s - 10724.94s] but it was usually port to port,
[10724.94s - 10726.58s] different merchants trading goods.
[10726.58s - 10731.22s] No, he organized a great fleet to send a queen,
[10731.22s - 10734.42s] or princess to become a queen in the Ilkhanate,
[10734.42s - 10737.14s] to marry the Ilkhan of Persia.
[10737.14s - 10741.38s] It's Persia and Azerbaijan and Armenia
[10741.38s - 10744.78s] and Iraq and part of Syria, all of that area.
[10744.78s - 10748.26s] So, he organized this and it so happened
[10748.26s - 10750.90s] that Marco Polo was ready to go home
[10750.90s - 10754.06s] because they knew Kubla Khan was about to die.
[10754.06s - 10756.82s] In fact, he only had about one year left to live
[10756.82s - 10758.50s] and they wanted to get their riches out
[10758.50s - 10759.82s] before they didn't know what's gonna happen.
[10759.82s - 10761.54s] This is a new dynasty.
[10761.54s - 10764.46s] They've been in total control of China for one generation
[10765.50s - 10767.82s] and they didn't know what was gonna happen.
[10767.82s - 10771.02s] And also just before that, there had been a bad sign
[10771.02s - 10775.10s] because Kubla Khan had tried to invade Japan a second time
[10775.10s - 10776.78s] and he had failed a second time.
[10777.66s - 10780.22s] And the second time, I think again,
[10780.22s - 10781.86s] he had a practical purpose
[10781.86s - 10785.06s] and that was he had this whole huge Song army
[10785.06s - 10786.98s] that now he's the new enlightened Mongol
[10786.98s - 10788.70s] who doesn't slaughter.
[10788.70s - 10790.06s] So, what is he gonna do?
[10790.06s - 10793.18s] They're not reliable, they're not safe.
[10793.18s - 10796.34s] So, he sends a bunch of them up into the Amur River
[10796.34s - 10798.90s] of what's now the Russian Far East,
[10798.90s - 10801.54s] we call Siberian English, but the Russian Far East,
[10801.54s - 10802.94s] the Amur River.
[10802.94s - 10805.10s] He sent expeditions up into Tibet
[10805.10s - 10808.26s] exploring options up there, but there wasn't enough room
[10808.30s - 10812.18s] or enough agricultural area for a huge military colony.
[10812.18s - 10816.50s] But most of his ships were loaded with former prisoners
[10816.50s - 10821.18s] of the war from the Song dynasty and they were not armed.
[10821.18s - 10824.10s] They had hoes and implements for farming.
[10824.10s - 10826.66s] He wanted to create obviously
[10826.66s - 10830.90s] an agricultural military agricultural farm in Japan
[10830.90s - 10834.14s] to help feed Northern China, because it was very important
[10834.14s - 10835.82s] just as they were doing with the Amur River,
[10835.82s - 10837.82s] but it was more complicated.
[10837.82s - 10842.82s] So, again, they lost, they didn't have it.
[10842.98s - 10846.86s] And part of the reason is that the expedition was massive
[10846.86s - 10848.94s] and they organized it in the Mongol principles
[10848.94s - 10850.38s] of left wing, right wing.
[10851.98s - 10853.66s] This didn't work at sea,
[10853.66s - 10857.74s] because the left wing is from Korea.
[10857.74s - 10859.62s] There's Korean ships built up there.
[10859.62s - 10862.38s] The right wing is from Southern China mostly
[10862.38s - 10863.86s] with ships built down there.
[10863.86s - 10865.70s] They're not the same, they have a head,
[10865.70s - 10867.26s] but there's no center point.
[10867.26s - 10869.50s] Chinggis Khan always had the goal, they called it,
[10869.50s - 10873.22s] G-O-L, the goal, the center, or Q-O-L, actually,
[10873.22s - 10874.70s] call it what they do.
[10874.70s - 10876.90s] He had the center in command.
[10876.90s - 10880.50s] No, he sent the two without a clear...
[10880.50s - 10882.70s] They were arguing with each other, not cooperating,
[10882.70s - 10885.30s] not helping each other, sabotaging each other.
[10885.30s - 10887.54s] They get there and once again, they have the same problems,
[10887.54s - 10890.90s] even though they've come with lots of grenades this time.
[10890.90s - 10892.94s] Again, the grenades are exploding,
[10892.94s - 10896.66s] they're scaring the horses, it's impressive.
[10896.66s - 10898.66s] And a lot of silk screens are made later
[10898.66s - 10902.94s] showing these impressive battles and all, but they lost.
[10902.94s - 10906.22s] And again, a typhoon happened to be
[10906.22s - 10910.66s] the final destruction of the Navy,
[10910.66s - 10915.62s] but I think Japan had defeated the Mongols, I would say.
[10916.54s - 10919.38s] Japanese deserve credit for that victory.
[10919.38s - 10923.82s] And then the sinking of the ships
[10923.82s - 10927.42s] was more caused by the typhoon.
[10927.42s - 10930.18s] But already the Japanese had developed good strategies
[10930.18s - 10931.46s] while the Mongols had been away.
[10931.46s - 10933.14s] They knew how the Mongols fought.
[10933.14s - 10936.82s] And they knew that at night they could fire flaming arrows
[10936.82s - 10938.86s] at the ships, set them on fire,
[10938.86s - 10940.70s] and they were doing great damage.
[10942.10s - 10945.78s] So again, Kublai Khan lost the invasion of Japan,
[10947.46s - 10951.18s] but the soldiers were gone, they drowned.
[10952.18s - 10955.86s] He didn't kill them off, was his deliberate plan,
[10955.86s - 10957.74s] but the problem was solved.
[10959.34s - 10962.42s] It's one of those ironies of history
[10962.42s - 10964.54s] that it's hard to quite understand.
[10964.54s - 10968.02s] So this had happened, but then Kublai Khan
[10969.42s - 10971.34s] was coming near the end of life,
[10971.34s - 10974.42s] and Marco Polo and those wanted to get out.
[10974.42s - 10977.74s] They're ready to go, and Kublai Khan allowed them to sail
[10978.54s - 10982.02s] on this expedition with Hexchin was her name,
[10982.02s - 10986.78s] the Princess Hexchin, to go to Hormuz.
[10988.02s - 10991.38s] And so they went, and that began a whole system of trade
[10991.38s - 10993.34s] back and forth, back and forth.
[10993.34s - 10996.26s] Kublai Khan died soon after that.
[10996.26s - 11000.10s] His grandson, who's not so well respected in history,
[11000.10s - 11002.34s] because he's often called a drunk,
[11002.34s - 11005.14s] but his name was Timur, Timur and Jetu.
[11005.18s - 11008.02s] But he was a drunk when he was young,
[11008.02s - 11013.02s] but his grandfather had him caned a couple times in public,
[11013.18s - 11015.34s] and he cured him of drinking.
[11015.34s - 11018.22s] And actually, he was not a drunk later on,
[11018.22s - 11022.22s] and he was, first he knew, reassembled the Mongol Empire.
[11022.22s - 11023.42s] He did.
[11023.42s - 11025.46s] The Golden Horde declared loyalty to him,
[11025.46s - 11027.10s] recognized him as Great Khan,
[11027.10s - 11029.14s] as emperor of the whole empire.
[11029.14s - 11032.18s] The Chagatayid of Central Asia,
[11032.18s - 11033.94s] they declared loyalty to him.
[11033.94s - 11036.90s] The Ilkhanate was already loyal to him.
[11036.90s - 11038.34s] They all declared loyalty.
[11038.34s - 11040.34s] He had reassembled the empire,
[11040.34s - 11042.46s] and he had the greatest navy in the world,
[11042.46s - 11044.86s] and he sent out envoys to every place
[11044.86s - 11047.82s] they had attacked or traded with to say,
[11047.82s - 11051.54s] that era is over, we're no longer attacking anybody.
[11051.54s - 11055.34s] We're changing from conquest to commerce.
[11055.34s - 11057.66s] We want to trade with you.
[11057.66s - 11059.94s] Come to China, bring your goods.
[11059.94s - 11061.50s] We're gonna trade with you.
[11061.50s - 11064.74s] He instituted, it was short, unfortunately,
[11064.74s - 11068.18s] it didn't last forever, I wish it could have,
[11068.18s - 11070.90s] but it was a great era of the exchange
[11070.90s - 11073.94s] of all kinds of things going back and forth,
[11073.94s - 11076.30s] all the way, actually all the way to Africa,
[11076.30s - 11079.94s] because from Hormuz, they had connection to Somaliland,
[11079.94s - 11082.34s] and some people say Kenya already at that time,
[11082.34s - 11085.54s] I'm not sure, but very wide, very wide.
[11085.54s - 11090.54s] So technically, he ruled over the largest size,
[11091.34s - 11093.82s] the Mongol empire ever had.
[11093.82s - 11096.86s] Yes, but although actually the golden horde of Russia,
[11096.86s - 11098.62s] they were quite independent by now,
[11098.62s - 11100.38s] and he let them be independent,
[11100.38s - 11101.70s] but they were loyal to him,
[11101.70s - 11104.46s] and they were still exchanging back and forth
[11104.46s - 11105.74s] all kinds of things.
[11105.74s - 11109.98s] So there were Ossetian soldiers in China.
[11111.94s - 11116.26s] They had a whole contingent of Ossetian soldiers there,
[11116.26s - 11119.70s] and from Russia, from the Caucasus areas of Russia.
[11119.74s - 11120.98s] And how do they communicate?
[11120.98s - 11122.78s] Are they using the postal service?
[11122.78s - 11126.30s] Do you have to literally deliver the letters?
[11126.30s - 11131.30s] No, over time, those groups started intermarrying with,
[11132.18s - 11134.38s] they were allowed to intermarry, the Chinese were not,
[11134.38s - 11136.78s] but they were intermarrying with Mongols,
[11136.78s - 11141.06s] and they were switching to Mongolian language slowly.
[11141.06s - 11143.66s] At first, I don't know, it's not clear.
[11143.66s - 11147.34s] But again, Kubla Khan, thinking in this internationalist way,
[11147.34s - 11150.34s] said, okay, we need a new alphabet for the world.
[11150.34s - 11152.78s] Everybody in the world writes with one alphabet.
[11152.78s - 11157.10s] Chinese, Mongolian, Russian, Arabic, everything.
[11157.94s - 11160.42s] It didn't work, but he tried it for a while,
[11160.42s - 11163.30s] and some inscriptions are still there to this day.
[11163.30s - 11167.02s] And we should maybe briefly mention Marco Polo
[11167.02s - 11168.24s] that you've talked about.
[11168.24s - 11171.74s] So he is this now famous explorer
[11171.74s - 11176.50s] that traversed the continent, the Silk Road,
[11176.50s - 11179.46s] and then stayed with Kubla Khan for a while.
[11179.46s - 11182.98s] And I guess one is one of the primary documenters
[11182.98s - 11185.34s] of everything that's been going on.
[11185.34s - 11187.78s] Is there something else interesting to say
[11187.78s - 11192.54s] about Marco Polo and about his interaction with Kubla Khan?
[11192.54s - 11193.90s] I like Marco Polo.
[11193.90s - 11197.62s] I use his work a lot.
[11197.62s - 11199.50s] I find him very reliable,
[11199.50s - 11200.98s] and the areas where he's not reliable,
[11200.98s - 11205.58s] you can kind of tell because he wasn't there,
[11205.58s - 11208.54s] but the places he was, he reported a lot of stuff.
[11208.54s - 11212.70s] And so I'm very much indebted to him for a lot of things
[11212.70s - 11216.10s] because with something like the Princess Huk Jin,
[11216.10s - 11218.42s] and also another fighting princess
[11218.42s - 11220.70s] from Central Asia named Hutilung,
[11220.70s - 11224.14s] he wrote about that, but I also needed other sources.
[11224.14s - 11227.14s] So if I could find Chinese sources or Arab sources
[11227.14s - 11229.90s] or something else or Persian to support it,
[11229.90s - 11234.18s] then I really felt a lot of confidence with him over time.
[11234.22s - 11236.14s] But pieces were romanticized,
[11236.14s - 11240.74s] and you have to always discount it, but it's very good.
[11240.74s - 11245.74s] However, I believe the best work written about Marco Polo,
[11246.62s - 11248.02s] aside from his own book,
[11248.02s - 11250.10s] which was actually written by Rusticello,
[11250.10s - 11252.90s] dictated in prison in January, you know.
[11252.90s - 11257.50s] In the 20th century, Eugene O'Neill wrote a play
[11257.50s - 11262.50s] that became a comedy on Broadway called Marco Millions.
[11263.02s - 11266.14s] That was both a play on what he was called,
[11266.14s - 11269.30s] El Milione, the million one,
[11269.30s - 11272.70s] because he had talked about cities of millions of people
[11272.70s - 11275.10s] and about money in the millions
[11275.10s - 11276.26s] and things that people in Europe
[11276.26s - 11278.02s] just couldn't believe could happen.
[11278.02s - 11280.82s] He then published his whole play as a book
[11280.82s - 11282.86s] to show people what he really meant.
[11282.86s - 11287.86s] And it was an ironic look at capitalism,
[11288.02s - 11290.70s] because this is 20th century already,
[11290.74s - 11294.14s] versus the idea of like a philosopher king,
[11294.14s - 11297.34s] which he saw in Kublai Khan.
[11297.34s - 11301.18s] And so Marco Polo becomes a symbol of capitalism,
[11301.18s - 11304.18s] not at its worst, but at its most basic.
[11306.98s - 11309.42s] And that is like the princess in the story,
[11309.42s - 11310.58s] this is not in real life,
[11310.58s - 11313.38s] but this is in the play written by Eugene O'Neill,
[11313.38s - 11315.06s] but I think it captures a lot.
[11315.06s - 11317.02s] The Princess Hoxhaen says,
[11317.10s - 11320.82s] Marco is an excellent judge of quantity.
[11322.02s - 11324.46s] And there were things like that.
[11325.74s - 11328.98s] And then in the play, Bayan, the great general,
[11330.30s - 11332.74s] he talks with Kublai Khan and he said,
[11332.74s - 11335.82s] look, these people are dangerous from the West,
[11335.82s - 11338.90s] we should go conquer them now while we can.
[11338.90s - 11341.70s] Kublai Khan tells Bayan, again, in the play,
[11341.70s - 11344.66s] this is fiction, but he tells Bayan,
[11344.66s - 11346.74s] they are not worth conquering.
[11346.74s - 11350.22s] And if we conquer them, we will become like them.
[11350.22s - 11352.98s] And he said, Marco Polo has been in our land,
[11352.98s - 11355.82s] he has seen everything, he has learned nothing.
[11356.86s - 11360.38s] He has seen everything, he understands nothing.
[11361.50s - 11363.90s] For me, this was such an important moment
[11363.90s - 11365.22s] in the history of the world,
[11365.22s - 11369.94s] symbolically with Marco Polo and Kublai Khan,
[11369.94s - 11372.02s] the coming together of two worlds,
[11372.86s - 11375.06s] it could have gone a different way,
[11375.06s - 11377.50s] it could have gone a different way.
[11377.50s - 11380.54s] And I am, it's not that I'm anti-capitalist,
[11380.54s - 11383.94s] I'm pro-capitalist, but the way so many things worked out,
[11385.70s - 11387.58s] it was a misstep in history.
[11387.58s - 11390.38s] Maybe we took the wrong step at that moment
[11390.38s - 11394.30s] and we could have learned more from cooperation.
[11394.30s - 11397.06s] They didn't quite integrate successfully.
[11397.06s - 11402.06s] No, but today, we've returned to that, I think.
[11402.30s - 11405.78s] I think the East and the West are confronting each other,
[11405.78s - 11408.34s] again, on more equal terms.
[11408.34s - 11411.22s] For a long time, the West was so dominant
[11411.22s - 11414.58s] and the East was so downtrodden by colonialism
[11414.58s - 11418.42s] and other things, and internal rot and other things.
[11418.42s - 11421.46s] But today, there's not necessarily equality,
[11421.46s - 11423.62s] but there's more of a balance.
[11423.62s - 11425.78s] And which way will we go?
[11425.78s - 11430.54s] And again, there's a lot of room
[11430.54s - 11434.34s] and a lot of energy for division,
[11434.34s - 11439.18s] for misunderstanding versus integration.
[11439.18s - 11444.18s] Like, the East is demonized in the West
[11444.18s - 11448.62s] and one of the great regrets I have
[11448.62s - 11450.54s] that I hope to alleviate
[11450.54s - 11455.54s] is just how little I understand China and the East.
[11455.94s - 11456.78s] Yes.
[11456.78s - 11460.42s] It's just sort of not just from kind of economics,
[11460.42s - 11463.66s] politics, you know, reading a few books,
[11463.66s - 11466.06s] but like the way you've understood
[11466.06s - 11468.46s] and felt the Mongolian step,
[11468.46s - 11470.58s] like understand the Chinese people in that way,
[11470.58s - 11474.10s] because it does feel like from that understanding,
[11474.10s - 11476.90s] there could be integration of ideas.
[11476.90s - 11480.98s] You know, my work is often classified as Chinese history,
[11480.98s - 11482.22s] which I think is ironic,
[11482.22s - 11485.50s] because for me, it's always a Mongolian history.
[11485.50s - 11487.66s] But for the last book I wrote,
[11487.66s - 11489.34s] which dealt a lot more with China
[11489.34s - 11491.86s] because it was about Kublai Khan,
[11491.86s - 11494.54s] then in that book, I deliberately did not go to China.
[11494.54s - 11496.46s] I'd been there numerous times before.
[11496.46s - 11497.98s] I deliberately did not.
[11497.98s - 11499.02s] I'm an outsider.
[11499.02s - 11500.30s] I do not speak Chinese.
[11500.30s - 11501.78s] I'm not a Chinese scholar.
[11501.78s - 11504.30s] I never even had a course in Chinese art
[11504.30s - 11506.30s] or calligraphy or anything.
[11506.30s - 11507.78s] And I wanted to be very clear.
[11507.78s - 11510.74s] Mine is an outside perspective.
[11510.74s - 11513.50s] But I think it's possible as an outsider
[11513.50s - 11517.54s] to still have respect for that culture.
[11517.54s - 11520.90s] Even if I disagree that they point this one as a hero
[11520.90s - 11523.14s] and that one's as the villain, I disagree.
[11523.14s - 11524.46s] And they'll say, oh, I'm wrong.
[11524.46s - 11525.54s] I don't understand their history.
[11525.54s - 11526.46s] And they're probably right.
[11526.46s - 11527.58s] That's quite possible.
[11527.58s - 11531.82s] But this is an outside view that is different
[11531.82s - 11533.70s] and tries to be respectful
[11533.70s - 11536.06s] of what happens in that part of the world.
[11536.06s - 11538.42s] Just as I'm respectful towards Chinggis Khan
[11538.42s - 11543.42s] and the Mongol Empire, I respect China very much.
[11543.42s - 11544.74s] I'm an American.
[11544.74s - 11547.14s] I love the ideals of my country.
[11547.14s - 11550.30s] I love so many aspects of our culture.
[11550.30s - 11552.78s] And there are many aspects I don't, of course,
[11552.78s - 11555.82s] because it's impossible to love everything
[11555.82s - 11558.74s] even about the members of your own family.
[11558.74s - 11563.74s] And I do hope that through understanding one another
[11563.98s - 11565.86s] or just making the effort to understand,
[11565.86s - 11569.54s] even if we understand wrongly and we're incorrect in it,
[11569.54s - 11573.50s] just to make the effort to understand will help us a lot.
[11573.50s - 11577.38s] And the West has had a long couple of centuries
[11577.38s - 11582.38s] of extreme arrogance that they are there to teach the world.
[11583.30s - 11587.14s] And I sometimes dismayed.
[11587.14s - 11589.86s] I meet these young people all over the world
[11589.86s - 11592.06s] who've come to help.
[11592.06s - 11594.54s] They're an NGO and they're gonna teach the people
[11594.54s - 11596.98s] how to take care of the environment.
[11596.98s - 11601.94s] They're gonna teach the women how to exercise their rights.
[11601.94s - 11604.66s] They're gonna bring in micro-financing
[11604.66s - 11606.26s] to help liberate people.
[11608.26s - 11611.34s] We are arrogant beyond words.
[11612.38s - 11614.50s] And we need to be a little bit more humble
[11614.50s - 11616.98s] and try to put ourselves on an equal basis
[11616.98s - 11620.74s] with some of these people, not a superior basis.
[11621.66s - 11622.74s] Beautifully put.
[11623.74s - 11627.34s] How did the Mongol Empire come to an end?
[11627.34s - 11628.58s] How did it fall?
[11631.82s - 11634.58s] Despite the fact that Timuro Jethuhan
[11634.58s - 11638.50s] had united the empire, at least symbolically, all of it,
[11638.50s - 11641.06s] and they had the trade going on,
[11641.06s - 11645.62s] the Mongols never adapted well to China
[11645.62s - 11648.54s] and they began having problems in different areas.
[11648.54s - 11650.50s] So in some areas of the world,
[11650.50s - 11652.58s] they became more like the local people.
[11652.66s - 11655.10s] So in Central Asia, they became Muslim
[11655.10s - 11657.94s] and they got more absorbed into that world
[11657.94s - 11661.90s] and broke away from the Mongol examples from before.
[11661.90s - 11665.90s] Russia lingered on longer under Mongol domination,
[11665.90s - 11668.22s] but it got weaker and weaker over time
[11668.22s - 11670.38s] and it was based around the Volga River,
[11670.38s - 11673.06s] but they weakened to the point that they just became
[11674.06s - 11677.66s] a tributary people minority within a Russian empire.
[11677.66s - 11682.34s] But the Mongols had left the framework for empire for Russia.
[11682.34s - 11684.34s] That's something the Russians don't want to hear anymore
[11684.34s - 11686.82s] than they want to hear me criticize
[11686.82s - 11688.98s] the end of the Song dynasty.
[11688.98s - 11693.10s] But it is true that even yam, yam is the word
[11693.10s - 11694.94s] that was used for this postal system
[11694.94s - 11697.66s] and that's the ministries today in Russia.
[11697.66s - 11700.74s] There are many, many other things in Russia.
[11700.74s - 11703.90s] It's just even malchik, malchin is a herder.
[11704.78s - 11707.70s] Mal is an animal and chin is a person
[11707.70s - 11709.18s] who takes care of animals.
[11709.18s - 11711.58s] You know, it's all kinds of influences in Russia
[11711.58s - 11713.14s] that some people want to deny,
[11713.14s - 11716.38s] but there's always a great powerful strand
[11716.38s - 11720.42s] of research and scholarship in Russia
[11720.42s - 11724.10s] that supports this understanding of the Mongols
[11724.10s - 11726.62s] and I depend on them tremendously.
[11726.62s - 11729.66s] It's not just Gumilyov is one of the famous ones,
[11729.66s - 11731.54s] but he was a little bit too romantic
[11731.54s - 11733.22s] with his ideas and all,
[11733.22s - 11737.10s] but I depend upon a lot of the research done
[11737.10s - 11740.22s] by Russian scholars and by early German scholars
[11740.22s - 11743.82s] in the 19th century under sponsorship of the Tsar.
[11745.22s - 11747.10s] So I depend on that work.
[11747.10s - 11752.02s] So you had a great influence there, but it was weakening.
[11752.02s - 11756.90s] So bit by bit, 1368, the Mongols had become so weak
[11756.90s - 11760.82s] within China that they were overthrown,
[11760.82s - 11763.26s] but they weren't absorbed into China.
[11764.54s - 11769.10s] The Mongols had been there since 1215 to 1368.
[11769.10s - 11771.74s] They packed up, went back to Mongolia.
[11771.74s - 11775.34s] It was just another seasonal migration.
[11775.34s - 11779.02s] You know, it was just amazing.
[11779.02s - 11781.46s] And they said, okay, we're still the Yuan dynasty.
[11781.46s - 11783.34s] We're not giving you the seals.
[11783.34s - 11784.98s] We're not acknowledging the Ming
[11784.98s - 11787.18s] and they never did throughout the whole of the Ming.
[11787.18s - 11788.14s] In fact, they went down one time
[11788.14s - 11791.14s] and captured the Ming emperor, took him back to Mongolia.
[11791.14s - 11793.78s] And then they tried to ransom him and the Chinese said,
[11793.78s - 11796.66s] no, we're going to appoint another emperor.
[11796.70s - 11798.46s] So the Mongols decided, okay,
[11799.66s - 11802.78s] the worst thing we can do to the Chinese is
[11802.78s - 11804.90s] give them back the old emperor.
[11804.90s - 11808.74s] So you had two emperors back, okay, let them work it out.
[11808.74s - 11813.34s] And the empire just weakened from internal reasons
[11813.34s - 11816.46s] for the Mongols, but some external things from nature.
[11816.46s - 11818.26s] And I think that was the great plague.
[11819.42s - 11820.90s] You know, everything in history,
[11820.90s - 11822.42s] everything that's good comes
[11822.42s - 11824.82s] with something underneath it that's bad.
[11824.82s - 11826.02s] And everything that's bad seems
[11826.02s - 11827.10s] to have something underneath
[11827.10s - 11829.98s] that sometimes works out good in a way.
[11829.98s - 11834.30s] But this great system that united,
[11834.30s - 11837.46s] it's called the Yam or Orto, Orto,
[11837.46s - 11838.62s] that united everything.
[11838.62s - 11840.62s] People could move back and forth quickly.
[11840.62s - 11844.58s] Then it could also take the plague out of Southern China
[11844.58s - 11846.70s] into all parts of the world.
[11846.70s - 11848.98s] And I do think that's what happened.
[11848.98s - 11853.26s] And the plague destroyed the Mongol system.
[11853.26s - 11855.78s] And if all of these people are ruled by Mongols
[11855.78s - 11859.18s] because they're benefiting so much from this system,
[11859.18s - 11860.78s] and now the system collapses,
[11861.94s - 11865.82s] you don't need the empire anymore.
[11865.82s - 11868.50s] So it just fell apart after 1368,
[11868.50s - 11870.58s] the empire just fell apart.
[11870.58s - 11875.58s] And most of them stayed in Persia and Iran and Afghanistan,
[11878.34s - 11881.34s] the Hazara people are still descended from the army there.
[11882.34s - 11885.74s] And then in Russia, some of them stayed.
[11885.74s - 11888.38s] But then finally, in the time of Catherine the Great,
[11888.38s - 11890.34s] a lot of them were returned.
[11890.34s - 11893.58s] Little pair, they had been there for hundreds of years.
[11893.58s - 11898.58s] And then they returned to Mongolia in the 1700s.
[11899.02s - 11902.26s] And so many Mongols came home.
[11902.26s - 11903.58s] They were still Mongols.
[11903.58s - 11907.74s] Despite hundreds of years of exposure to other cultures,
[11907.74s - 11910.66s] they came back to their tent and squatting around the fire.
[11911.34s - 11914.74s] Drinking fermented milk and eating dried curds.
[11914.74s - 11918.50s] It's interesting that the Mongolian spirit
[11918.50s - 11923.50s] is so strong that it persists through centuries.
[11924.22s - 11927.78s] And they just return right back on the horse,
[11927.78s - 11929.66s] riding in the open step.
[11929.66s - 11932.10s] Yeah, well, it was actually very difficult
[11932.10s - 11934.54s] because they were a little bit lazy
[11934.54s - 11937.06s] and they weren't so good with doing the task.
[11937.06s - 11940.02s] And so it became difficult actually
[11940.06s - 11942.34s] to support so many people coming home
[11943.98s - 11945.70s] and eating up all the animals.
[11945.70s - 11948.34s] The Mongols in China had been used to just eating.
[11948.34s - 11951.18s] They hadn't been producing much for 150 years.
[11952.30s - 11954.90s] So just to return to Genghis Khan,
[11956.06s - 11957.74s] we talked about Dan Carlin.
[11957.74s - 11962.74s] And Dan Carlin said that Genghis Khan's army
[11963.50s - 11966.14s] was the greatest military force in history.
[11967.06s - 11969.06s] And many other historians agree
[11969.06s - 11972.02s] that before rifles came into popular use,
[11972.02s - 11976.74s] Genghis Khan would basically beat every single army,
[11976.74s - 11979.14s] including Napoleon.
[11979.14s - 11982.34s] And you mentioned the samurai, the whole formal setup,
[11982.34s - 11983.38s] same with Napoleon.
[11983.38s - 11988.38s] There's a whole, like several hours to set up
[11988.66s - 11991.14s] the chess pieces on the military board.
[11991.14s - 11993.74s] I mean, you can just imagine what Genghis Khan
[11993.74s - 11998.74s] and the dynamism, the speed of everything,
[11998.74s - 12000.70s] what that would do to Napoleon.
[12000.70s - 12005.26s] So I guess the question is where do you agree
[12005.26s - 12008.22s] with that notion that Genghis Khan's army
[12008.22s - 12010.22s] is the greatest military force in history?
[12010.22s - 12013.14s] Short answer is yes, absolutely.
[12013.14s - 12016.86s] No other power in the history of the world
[12016.86s - 12021.86s] has conquered Russia and China and Persia
[12022.22s - 12026.46s] and Central Asia and Turkey and Korea.
[12027.46s - 12031.10s] No power in the world has done that,
[12031.10s - 12033.86s] not Alexander, not the Romans.
[12033.86s - 12035.74s] Nobody will ever do it again.
[12035.74s - 12038.22s] Nobody's gonna conquer China and Russia again
[12038.22s - 12040.26s] and rule both countries.
[12040.26s - 12041.62s] It's just not gonna happen.
[12041.62s - 12044.66s] What lessons, I mean, can you take from,
[12044.66s - 12047.14s] that's applicable to modern warfare?
[12047.14s - 12049.14s] Oh, I think there's a very good lesson.
[12051.58s - 12056.10s] The Mongols took Iraq, they took Baghdad, they held it.
[12056.94s - 12061.58s] The Americans, we followed the exact opposite strategy
[12061.58s - 12062.66s] of the Mongols.
[12063.50s - 12066.26s] Mongol strategy is first you take the countryside.
[12066.26s - 12068.74s] They're country people, they think in terms of countryside.
[12068.74s - 12071.86s] You take the countryside, you occupy the countryside
[12071.86s - 12073.58s] and you cut off the city.
[12073.58s - 12076.82s] It cannot live without the countryside.
[12076.82s - 12078.70s] And that's how they did it every time.
[12078.70s - 12080.26s] They would come in, as I say, in some cases,
[12080.26s - 12082.94s] two years in advance to clear people out
[12082.94s - 12084.70s] so they would have room for their horses
[12084.78s - 12086.82s] and have pasture for their horses and all.
[12086.82s - 12089.46s] And you take the small towns and then the small cities.
[12089.46s - 12091.86s] And then the last one is the big city.
[12091.86s - 12094.54s] Americans, they say, no, we're gonna take Baghdad.
[12094.54s - 12095.66s] We're gonna bomb Baghdad.
[12095.66s - 12097.58s] We're gonna have this shock and awe.
[12097.58s - 12100.98s] We're gonna go in, we'll conquer the country from Baghdad.
[12100.98s - 12102.38s] So they go in, they get trapped
[12102.38s - 12105.54s] in their little tiny green zone.
[12105.54s - 12107.98s] They never conquer Iraq.
[12107.98s - 12109.94s] It's the strongest army in the world.
[12109.94s - 12111.86s] You know, this is something that worked in Europe.
[12111.86s - 12114.38s] World War II, yes, we bombed the cities
[12114.42s - 12116.62s] and we took the city because that was the city,
[12116.62s - 12119.66s] the center of production for the modern era.
[12119.66s - 12123.42s] But the countryside is the place that produces the food.
[12123.42s - 12124.86s] The Mongols were very aware of that
[12124.86s - 12126.14s] and supplies the water.
[12126.14s - 12127.70s] You cut off the water from the city.
[12127.70s - 12129.50s] You cut off the food from the city.
[12129.50s - 12130.70s] What's the city going to do?
[12130.70s - 12132.06s] They're going to surrender.
[12133.10s - 12134.94s] The Americans were applying something
[12134.94s - 12137.46s] that worked in Western Europe to conquer Germany.
[12138.62s - 12142.54s] It did not work to conquer Iraq or Vietnam
[12142.54s - 12147.26s] or even Northern Korea or Cambodia or Laos or Syria
[12147.26s - 12149.42s] or God knows, it worked only in Grenada.
[12149.42s - 12151.46s] I think that's the only, in my lifetime,
[12151.46s - 12153.74s] that's the only successful war we had.
[12153.74s - 12154.90s] Lasted a couple of hours.
[12154.90s - 12158.30s] We went in, conquered the little tiny island.
[12159.22s - 12161.98s] Otherwise, we've been chased out of every country.
[12161.98s - 12164.82s] We've lost it, tail between our legs.
[12166.10s - 12169.42s] We dropped more bombs on Cambodia
[12169.42s - 12170.90s] than we dropped on Germany.
[12173.54s - 12177.38s] It's hard to believe, hard to believe.
[12177.38s - 12180.82s] We dropped more bombs on Cambodia than on Germany.
[12180.82s - 12182.38s] We did nothing because Germany,
[12182.38s - 12184.94s] you destroy the cities that people surrender.
[12184.94s - 12187.50s] Dresden is gone, Frankfurt, Würzburg, Berlin.
[12188.46s - 12192.46s] In Cambodia, you can bomb the countryside forever.
[12192.46s - 12194.54s] You can kill the people and they did.
[12194.54s - 12197.06s] You can use chemical warfare and they did.
[12198.06s - 12201.66s] And you could still go into the Eastern part of Cambodia
[12201.66s - 12205.82s] and you could go to how large areas
[12205.82s - 12207.90s] where you don't hear birds singing
[12207.90s - 12212.90s] because of the chemical warfare of American bombs.
[12212.90s - 12215.90s] So we still do it, but we don't want to admit it
[12215.90s - 12217.98s] and we don't want to go in to win.
[12217.98s - 12220.26s] In World War II, the Americans did have
[12221.46s - 12223.42s] unconditional surrender.
[12223.42s - 12225.38s] Well, I mean, you can support the war, not support the war.
[12225.38s - 12226.86s] We did it right, we did it wrong.
[12226.86s - 12229.26s] These are all issues that people can argue,
[12229.26s - 12231.26s] but we had a clear policy.
[12231.90s - 12235.74s] We go into Afghanistan, we're fighting terror.
[12235.74s - 12239.38s] We're going to bring democracy, we're going to free the women.
[12239.38s - 12240.50s] What?
[12240.50s - 12244.78s] I mean, it's absolute sheer insanity, the things that we did.
[12244.78s - 12246.78s] And we kill people.
[12246.78s - 12249.66s] Not only did we use chemical warfare
[12249.66s - 12253.82s] and kill a lot of people in Vietnam and Laos and Cambodia,
[12253.82s - 12256.18s] we killed American soldiers.
[12256.18s - 12259.78s] We killed American soldiers and my father was one.
[12259.82s - 12263.10s] He died from Agent Orange disease.
[12265.26s - 12267.58s] Oh, but that doesn't count.
[12267.58s - 12268.98s] He didn't die on the battlefield
[12268.98s - 12270.78s] and we didn't mean to kill him.
[12270.78s - 12271.78s] It doesn't count.
[12272.66s - 12274.38s] Modern warfare is brutal
[12275.62s - 12279.46s] and we just paper over it sometimes, you know?
[12279.46s - 12281.26s] Can you explain Agent Orange?
[12281.26s - 12284.82s] It was designed to kill all vegetation.
[12284.82s - 12287.02s] This is going to be a humane way.
[12287.02s - 12289.54s] We're going to kill all the vegetation in the jungle
[12289.54s - 12291.50s] and that way they can stop moving the army
[12291.50s - 12294.42s] through the jungle and they can stop the supplies from coming.
[12294.42s - 12296.06s] That was the American strategy.
[12297.26s - 12300.06s] Yeah, Henry Kissinger, Nobel Prize winner.
[12300.06s - 12302.38s] He is now resting in hell.
[12302.38s - 12304.38s] That's exactly where he belongs
[12304.38s - 12308.10s] for what he did to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
[12308.10s - 12310.78s] The bombing was just absolutely horrendous.
[12310.78s - 12313.22s] So Agent Orange comes in, they defoliated,
[12313.22s - 12314.62s] which means they wiped out the crops
[12314.62s - 12316.02s] so people are starving,
[12316.02s - 12319.90s] literally in the case of Cambodia starving to death.
[12319.90s - 12321.26s] The animals are being killed
[12321.26s - 12324.22s] and deformed children are being born to this day.
[12324.22s - 12328.86s] And American soldiers died by the thousands,
[12328.86s - 12333.78s] not immediately, not on the battlefield, not right there.
[12333.78s - 12337.38s] They go home, they have the disease, they linger.
[12337.38s - 12339.22s] They take the whole family down with them
[12339.22s - 12341.70s] in an emotional trauma
[12341.70s - 12344.26s] of becoming slowly paralyzed and dying.
[12346.02s - 12348.22s] We did that to our own people.
[12348.22s - 12352.94s] So yeah, warfare, I don't think we're any more humane
[12352.94s - 12356.06s] with it any better today than in the past.
[12356.06s - 12359.46s] It's just, we can hide parts of it more easily
[12359.46s - 12360.98s] and deny it more easily.
[12361.98s - 12363.14s] If you're killed by a Mongol,
[12363.14s - 12364.82s] it's very clear you're killed by a Mongol.
[12364.82s - 12368.50s] You're killed by friendly fire in American war.
[12368.50s - 12370.26s] It's a different matter.
[12370.26s - 12375.26s] It seems that what people mean when they say
[12375.26s - 12379.50s] that war is hell, that in some deep sense, everybody loses
[12379.50s - 12382.70s] no matter the narrative you put on top of it.
[12382.70s - 12384.46s] Yes, yes.
[12385.46s - 12387.10s] I'm not a pacifist again,
[12387.10s - 12391.94s] but I think war is acceptable in some situations,
[12391.94s - 12394.94s] but the more controlled it is, the better.
[12397.46s - 12402.26s] My effort is not to do away with all the things
[12402.26s - 12403.86s] that happened under Chinggis Khan
[12403.86s - 12405.70s] with the brutality and all like that,
[12405.70s - 12408.70s] but it's to measure it against what goes on today
[12408.70s - 12410.02s] in the world today.
[12410.02s - 12411.46s] And we have different images.
[12411.46s - 12413.38s] There are two images of Chinggis Khan.
[12413.38s - 12414.38s] One is our image.
[12414.38s - 12415.98s] He's a barbarian on a horseback,
[12415.98s - 12418.46s] killing people and raping women all the time.
[12418.46s - 12420.78s] The other image is a Mongolian image.
[12420.78s - 12423.42s] And when they finally built an official statue of him
[12424.42s - 12428.98s] in this century for the 800th anniversary
[12428.98s - 12430.70s] of his founding of Mongolia,
[12431.70s - 12434.50s] they had to think about how to present him to the world
[12434.50s - 12436.22s] and to themselves.
[12436.22s - 12440.62s] And they chose the Lincoln Memorial as the model.
[12440.62s - 12444.94s] He was the late great log river of the Mongol nation.
[12444.94s - 12446.18s] And so he's seated there
[12446.18s - 12448.10s] in front of the Mongolian parliament.
[12449.26s - 12450.98s] There's another statue that's better known,
[12450.98s - 12453.02s] but it was a private enterprise
[12453.02s - 12456.62s] that created him on horseback, but not with a weapon,
[12456.62s - 12459.78s] but he's on horseback out in the countryside.
[12459.82s - 12462.10s] But the official one from the government
[12462.10s - 12465.82s] is Chinggis Khan seated like Abraham Lincoln.
[12465.82s - 12468.02s] And they issued stamps to show
[12468.02s - 12470.58s] that he is the great log giver.
[12470.58s - 12475.58s] And the truth is somewhere in between, I suppose.
[12475.78s - 12478.14s] Well, depending on where you are
[12478.14s - 12480.10s] and how you want to see it, you know?
[12480.10s - 12480.94s] Yeah.
[12480.94s - 12483.14s] There are many things that happened
[12483.14s - 12484.94s] that were terrible and horrible.
[12484.94s - 12486.62s] And for people who lose a war,
[12486.62s - 12488.74s] it's gonna always be terrible and horrible.
[12488.74s - 12489.58s] Yeah.
[12490.66s - 12493.34s] Let's return back to Chinggis Khan's life
[12493.34s - 12494.34s] and the end of it.
[12495.26s - 12497.18s] How and where did he die?
[12499.22s - 12503.02s] After conquering the Haudenosaunee empire in Central Asia,
[12503.02s - 12504.38s] Chinggis Khan returned,
[12504.38s - 12505.46s] and then they had a great,
[12505.46s - 12506.30s] what they called Naadam,
[12506.30s - 12507.98s] a great celebration that went on
[12507.98s - 12509.50s] for a whole summer just about.
[12509.50s - 12512.54s] And they had so much wealth to distribute to everybody.
[12512.54s - 12515.38s] And everybody is being given all kinds of things,
[12515.38s - 12517.62s] you know, for what they have done,
[12518.10s - 12519.90s] including the people who helped saved him
[12519.90s - 12523.94s] when he was in the kank, in the ox yoke.
[12523.94s - 12526.50s] They were rewarded with, everybody was rewarded.
[12526.50s - 12527.70s] It was a great time.
[12527.70s - 12531.46s] But the first place he had attacked outside
[12531.46s - 12533.42s] was the Tangut nation,
[12533.42s - 12535.42s] and they had sworn allegiance to him.
[12535.42s - 12537.34s] And then when he went off to the Middle East,
[12537.34s - 12538.86s] they refused to send troops.
[12540.58s - 12541.82s] He didn't forget that.
[12541.82s - 12544.18s] He's going back to the Tangut nation,
[12544.18s - 12546.98s] and he's going to conquer them again.
[12547.02s - 12551.54s] As he was crossing the Gobi, which takes a while,
[12551.54s - 12553.46s] and you're crossing the Gobi,
[12553.46s - 12556.26s] he was distracted a little bit by hunting the Hulan,
[12556.26s - 12558.38s] which is the wild, we say the wild ass,
[12558.38s - 12561.90s] or I used to say wild horse, it sounds a little better.
[12561.90s - 12565.54s] But the Hulan, to say Hulan of the Gobi,
[12565.54s - 12568.18s] he was off hunting Hulan, he fell from his horse,
[12568.18s - 12570.82s] and he injured his leg very badly.
[12570.82s - 12574.10s] And he seemed to decline from that point.
[12574.10s - 12576.14s] And it took some number of months.
[12576.98s - 12581.34s] Before August of 1227, he was very much near the end of life.
[12582.78s - 12584.94s] You can read online the exact date,
[12584.94s - 12586.30s] and it's all very specific,
[12586.30s - 12588.54s] but the truth is we don't know exactly
[12588.54s - 12590.86s] which day he died in that time,
[12590.86s - 12594.18s] because one of his wives was running the camp,
[12594.18s - 12596.18s] and they were keeping it secret
[12596.18s - 12601.18s] until the defeat of the Tangut was completed.
[12601.94s - 12604.46s] And the Tangut offered all kinds of things
[12604.58s - 12607.90s] for the Mongols to go away again the second time.
[12607.90s - 12611.94s] And Chinggis Khan told his family, no, except nothing.
[12611.94s - 12613.42s] And then when they surrender,
[12613.42s - 12616.54s] you kill the royal family, kill them all.
[12616.54s - 12621.46s] So that the idea, they were Buddhist people,
[12621.46s - 12623.02s] the Tanguts were Buddhist,
[12623.02s - 12625.82s] and the idea was usually you can be reborn
[12625.82s - 12627.78s] into your own family.
[12627.78s - 12629.82s] But he said, no, you kill off the whole family
[12629.82s - 12631.22s] so they can't be reborn.
[12631.22s - 12633.62s] So he died there.
[12633.62s - 12636.06s] How was his successor chosen?
[12636.06s - 12640.06s] Oh, the succession issue was always difficult.
[12640.06s - 12643.62s] He did not have the right to appoint a successor.
[12643.62s - 12645.42s] That was not the Mongol way.
[12646.46s - 12648.06s] He could nominate somebody.
[12649.42s - 12653.42s] So before he set off for the Middle Eastern campaign,
[12654.42s - 12656.58s] one of his wives said to him,
[12656.58s - 12659.30s] you know, even the biggest tree falls.
[12659.78s - 12661.54s] You've got to make a plan
[12661.54s - 12664.26s] and talk to your sons about the future.
[12664.26s - 12665.10s] So he did.
[12665.10s - 12666.94s] He called the sons together.
[12666.94s - 12668.78s] So this is Zhuch.
[12668.78s - 12670.70s] The oldest boy who was born
[12670.70s - 12674.90s] while the father was allied with his Anda, Zhumuk.
[12674.90s - 12676.90s] And he was named visitor Zhuch.
[12677.86s - 12681.10s] And then the next one was Chagatai.
[12682.26s - 12684.58s] And the next one was Okudai.
[12684.58s - 12687.58s] And the next one was Chagatai.
[12688.42s - 12692.66s] And the next one was Tala, the father of Kublai Khan,
[12692.66s - 12695.14s] but he was still alive at this point.
[12695.14s - 12696.82s] So all four of them came.
[12696.82s - 12698.50s] So Chinggis Khan explained to them,
[12698.50s - 12700.74s] he wanted to talk about the succession
[12700.74s - 12704.10s] and to get some consensus from them about the succession.
[12704.10s - 12708.02s] And so he said, the Mongols always call on people
[12708.02s - 12709.98s] to speak by order of age.
[12709.98s - 12713.14s] They also serve tea or food, anything by order of age.
[12713.14s - 12715.70s] It's always done that way from then till now.
[12715.70s - 12717.86s] So he called first on Zhuch.
[12717.86s - 12720.46s] And he said, what do you say, Zhuch?
[12720.46s - 12722.30s] Chinggis Khan favored Zhuch.
[12722.30s - 12725.06s] This is the one who was questionable paternity,
[12725.06s - 12726.62s] but he always favored him.
[12727.82s - 12730.10s] The youngest Tala was too hot-headed.
[12730.10s - 12732.10s] Okudai was a heavy drinker.
[12732.10s - 12735.46s] Chagatai was very rigid about the law of the Mongols
[12735.46s - 12738.98s] and all, but he seemed to favor Zhuch
[12738.98s - 12742.58s] as a more reasonable, good warrior, but reasonable person.
[12742.66s - 12745.90s] But he called on Zhuch, my son, speak.
[12745.90s - 12747.86s] Chagatai, the second one,
[12747.86s - 12751.82s] who believes in Mongol law supposedly, he jumped up.
[12751.82s - 12756.22s] And he said, this is when he accused his father
[12756.22s - 12759.34s] of all kinds of, he said, how can you call on this Mongol,
[12759.34s - 12760.70s] this mercant bastard?
[12760.70s - 12761.86s] If you call on him first,
[12761.86s - 12764.10s] that means you want him to be the great Khan.
[12764.10s - 12766.86s] He should not be the great Khan of the Mongol Empire.
[12766.86s - 12768.70s] Is this Mongol Empire or not?
[12768.70s - 12771.42s] On and on, you know, you can imagine kind of scene.
[12771.42s - 12775.06s] Well, Genghis Khan is the greatest ruler in the world.
[12775.06s - 12779.62s] He's sitting there being lectured by his second son.
[12780.82s - 12785.38s] And this is when he gave that impassioned speech to his.
[12785.38s - 12787.74s] Now, and actually the way the secret history,
[12787.74s - 12791.38s] it makes it look like it was his assistant speaker
[12791.38s - 12794.06s] who said it, because very often the great power
[12794.06s - 12796.70s] doesn't say the words directly.
[12796.70s - 12798.18s] They let somebody else say them for them,
[12798.18s - 12799.02s] have a spokesperson.
[12799.02s - 12800.98s] But anyway, I think it was his words
[12800.98s - 12802.74s] that I think he said them on that day.
[12802.74s - 12805.02s] That's what I think of this business of,
[12805.02s - 12807.18s] you do not know, you are not there.
[12807.18s - 12808.98s] You know, the stars were moving in the sky,
[12808.98s - 12811.94s] the head was turning around, the earth was turning over.
[12811.94s - 12813.66s] You do not know who loved whom.
[12813.66s - 12815.46s] You do not know who your mother loved.
[12815.46s - 12817.34s] You do not know what your mother did.
[12817.34s - 12819.54s] And if I say he is my son,
[12819.54s - 12822.38s] who are you to say he is not my son?
[12823.66s - 12826.66s] By the way, pretty just really high integrity,
[12827.06s - 12829.50s] really respectable to do that.
[12829.50s - 12834.50s] To have that respect and honor his wife in this way
[12835.50s - 12837.94s] and his son in this way is really powerful.
[12837.94s - 12840.50s] I believe that, I don't know if she was alive
[12840.50s - 12841.34s] at this point or not.
[12841.34s - 12843.42s] We do not have the death recorded.
[12843.42s - 12845.74s] Mongols are not good at recording death.
[12845.74s - 12849.38s] They don't, they usually just say somebody finished their age
[12849.38s - 12852.14s] or they have some euphemism for it.
[12852.58s - 12855.46s] But he made that impassioned speech
[12855.46s - 12858.06s] and Sagadeh had to submit and he said,
[12858.06s - 12862.38s] yes, you are a father and we accept what you say,
[12862.38s - 12867.38s] but a deer shot with words cannot be loaded on a horse.
[12867.94s - 12870.82s] A deer shot with words cannot be eaten.
[12872.66s - 12876.38s] So Chinggis Khan knew.
[12877.66s - 12879.22s] So he said to the Sangha,
[12879.22s - 12881.30s] I mean, these are middle-aged men, they're not boys,
[12881.30s - 12884.94s] but he said to the men, what do you want to do?
[12884.94s - 12886.30s] What do you want to do?
[12886.30s - 12889.14s] And he said, I don't favor Sagadeh
[12890.10s - 12895.10s] because of his attitude and the situation.
[12895.50s - 12897.86s] And Tolo is still hot-headed
[12897.86s - 12901.90s] and he actually ended up being drunk and dying early.
[12901.90s - 12904.50s] So, but the other guys, they said, well, a good day.
[12904.50s - 12906.78s] They chose him, they chose him, they chose him.
[12906.78s - 12908.62s] The other guys, they said, well, a good day.
[12908.62s - 12912.50s] They chose him because he was the most generous
[12912.50s - 12915.98s] and the bon vivant and he was for every party
[12915.98s - 12918.14s] and drinking every time.
[12918.14s - 12922.10s] And yeah, one time, Chigi Hutuk, the great judge
[12922.10s - 12923.66s] who wrote The Secret History,
[12923.66s - 12927.30s] Chigi Hutuk was sleeping on a cart one time
[12927.30s - 12928.98s] for whatever reason, I don't know what.
[12928.98s - 12931.70s] I think he also had passed out drunk perhaps.
[12931.70s - 12934.38s] But a good day came out drunk and grabbed him up
[12934.38s - 12936.06s] and pulled him back into the party
[12936.34s - 12937.90s] and a good day was a party guy.
[12937.90s - 12941.66s] And so he was chosen as the next great Han
[12941.66s - 12943.58s] of the Mongol Empire.
[12943.58s - 12947.82s] But fortunately, there was sort of a plan B
[12947.82s - 12952.02s] and that Chinggis Khan had set up very powerful women,
[12952.02s - 12955.30s] his daughters, but also he had chosen wives
[12955.30s - 12959.42s] for each of his son, very, very capable wives.
[12959.42s - 12961.70s] And for a good day, he had a wife.
[12961.70s - 12963.10s] It wasn't even his first wife.
[12963.10s - 12965.58s] The first wife would usually be somebody
[12965.58s - 12968.30s] closer by certain clan or something,
[12968.30s - 12971.82s] but he had a very intelligent woman named Dorjin.
[12971.82s - 12974.14s] And then she was more or less ruling
[12974.14s - 12975.78s] in his last few years.
[12975.78s - 12979.06s] And then after he died, she ruled an empire
[12981.02s - 12982.42s] in her own name.
[12982.42s - 12985.46s] She was the ruler of the greatest empire in the world
[12985.46s - 12986.98s] ever ruled by a woman.
[12987.86s - 12988.82s] It's incredible.
[12988.82s - 12991.70s] The genius of Chinggis to set it up that way.
[12991.70s - 12992.78s] Yes.
[12992.78s - 12997.10s] And to not, you know, there's probably
[12998.54s - 13002.10s] very widespread discrimination of women at that time.
[13002.10s - 13004.18s] And to have not care about any of that
[13004.18s - 13006.62s] and just making the right decision
[13006.62s - 13009.82s] for like what it will keep the empire together.
[13009.82s - 13012.02s] And Dorjin was, actually there was peace.
[13012.02s - 13014.26s] She stopped all campaigns.
[13014.26s - 13015.46s] There was peace during her time.
[13015.46s - 13018.70s] And the women like such as Dorjin and others
[13018.70s - 13021.58s] were extremely into economics and trade
[13021.58s - 13024.34s] and running these, they had these private corporations
[13024.34s - 13025.46s] called orthok.
[13025.46s - 13027.70s] She was running her orthok and everything.
[13027.70s - 13029.94s] So she became much more interested in economics
[13029.94s - 13032.46s] of the trade and running the empire.
[13032.46s - 13033.54s] And it was the time of peace.
[13033.54s - 13036.82s] And she recognized that peace was better for trade.
[13036.82s - 13037.86s] It was better.
[13037.86s - 13040.10s] And so it was a peaceful time.
[13040.10s - 13043.86s] But like all of us, you know, we have our weak points
[13043.86s - 13048.86s] and she favored a worthless son to become the successor.
[13049.02s - 13051.94s] And none of the sons actually were great,
[13051.94s - 13053.62s] but a good they had favored another.
[13053.62s - 13056.98s] But anyway, she favored Goyuk, her son.
[13056.98s - 13061.98s] And so she arranged to have him made the great emperor
[13062.78s - 13064.06s] while she was still alive.
[13064.06s - 13067.78s] And she had a, her primary minister was also a woman
[13067.78s - 13069.78s] named Fatima from the Middle East.
[13069.78s - 13074.78s] And unfortunately Goyuk organized a purge of her court.
[13075.78s - 13077.54s] And killed off a lot of these people
[13077.54s - 13079.54s] who had been supporting her.
[13079.54s - 13082.66s] And a lot of them were Muslims and he killed off a lot.
[13082.66s - 13085.18s] And then he was gonna march against the golden horde
[13085.18s - 13086.98s] because they weren't supporting him.
[13088.02s - 13090.14s] So he set off and he died.
[13090.14s - 13095.14s] He was only in office for 18 months and he was gone.
[13096.54s - 13099.54s] And then his wife took over, Uncle Kamish.
[13099.54s - 13102.58s] Unfortunately, she was not capable as her son.
[13102.74s - 13104.66s] Unfortunately, she was not capable
[13104.66s - 13106.62s] as her mother-in-law at the origin.
[13106.62s - 13108.78s] Uncle Kamish was a bit greedy
[13108.78s - 13111.54s] and she didn't start any new wars,
[13111.54s - 13113.82s] but she just kind of messed up things
[13113.82s - 13115.26s] and she didn't rule for too long.
[13115.26s - 13118.74s] And this is why Kubla Khan's mother, Sorkhtani,
[13118.74s - 13120.62s] was able to have a revolution.
[13120.62s - 13123.10s] She united with the golden horde.
[13123.10s - 13125.86s] She was on one end on China, she had Northern China.
[13125.86s - 13127.46s] The golden horde had Russia.
[13127.46s - 13130.30s] The two of them united against the center
[13130.34s - 13133.58s] and they overthrew Uncle Kamish
[13133.58s - 13136.34s] and she put her son, Monk Khan, in,
[13136.34s - 13138.18s] who was succeeded by Kubla Khan.
[13138.18s - 13142.78s] And we should say probably that this whole succession by kin
[13142.78s - 13145.34s] probably goes against the initial spirit
[13145.34s - 13147.86s] of what Genghis Khan stood for.
[13147.86s - 13148.94s] Yes, yes.
[13148.94s - 13153.94s] In the end, he was a father and he favored his sons,
[13154.62s - 13156.74s] even knowing they were not so capable.
[13156.74s - 13159.02s] And he had lost a grandson that he loved.
[13161.30s - 13166.30s] But he organized it though as what we call today
[13166.98s - 13168.58s] almost a corporation.
[13168.58s - 13172.86s] All lands belong to everybody in the family, everybody.
[13172.86s - 13176.26s] So Kubla Khan, that's why he had soldiers.
[13176.26s - 13179.42s] There were Christian soldiers, Ossetian soldiers,
[13179.42s - 13180.50s] and Kipchak soldiers.
[13180.50s - 13183.26s] He had 10,000 of each come in.
[13183.26s - 13185.38s] And then they owned,
[13185.38s - 13188.10s] the Russians would own silk factories in China.
[13188.10s - 13190.18s] The Ilkhanid would own silk factories
[13190.18s - 13192.58s] and jade mines in China.
[13192.58s - 13195.46s] The people in China, the Mongols,
[13195.46s - 13198.86s] they would own villages in Persia and in Iran.
[13198.86s - 13201.38s] So he organized it all as everything was owned
[13201.38s - 13203.86s] by the entire clan.
[13204.94s - 13206.26s] It didn't last too long.
[13207.66s - 13210.26s] I like that because of the divisions that developed.
[13210.26s - 13215.26s] So the great Khan was primarily in charge of conquering
[13215.26s - 13216.58s] and expanding the land
[13216.58s - 13219.02s] so they had more lands to own.
[13219.02s - 13220.46s] That wasn't gonna be the job.
[13222.02s - 13223.38s] And Kubla Khan fulfilled it.
[13223.38s - 13225.34s] Monk Khan to some extent fulfilled it.
[13225.34s - 13226.42s] Oh, good they did.
[13226.42s - 13227.38s] Kuik did not.
[13228.38s - 13231.86s] It was family ruling the land,
[13231.86s - 13233.26s] all the different territories.
[13233.26s - 13236.58s] Yeah, and they weakened with every generation.
[13236.58s - 13237.42s] Yeah.
[13237.42s - 13238.78s] Every generation.
[13238.78s - 13242.86s] But that reminds me of a very popular idea
[13242.86s - 13245.46s] about Genghis Khan.
[13247.58s - 13250.90s] Articulated in the 2003 paper
[13250.90s - 13253.46s] titled The Genetic Legacy of the Mongols.
[13253.46s - 13257.14s] So that paper has a finding that estimates
[13257.14s - 13260.82s] that 0.5% of the world's male population
[13260.82s - 13264.86s] is direct descendants of Genghis Khan.
[13264.86s - 13267.18s] I've heard you kind of be a little bit skeptical
[13267.18s - 13271.10s] of this paper, but I actually really like its findings.
[13271.10s - 13273.90s] I talked to a good friend of mine, Manolis Kellis,
[13273.90s - 13278.30s] who's a computational biologist and geneticist,
[13278.30s - 13280.06s] and he likes the paper as well.
[13280.06s - 13282.14s] I find it really convincing,
[13282.14s - 13284.58s] but I think your skepticism has to do
[13284.58s - 13287.02s] not necessarily with the paper's contents
[13287.02s - 13290.50s] but more the implication that it speaks to,
[13290.50s - 13293.34s] like the thing that maybe the people who think
[13293.34s - 13296.10s] of Genghis Khan as a brutal barbarian
[13298.86s - 13302.30s] assume that the reason it's 0.5% of the population
[13302.30s - 13306.02s] is because of some institutionalized mass rape
[13306.02s - 13307.94s] conducted by Genghis Khan.
[13307.94s - 13311.54s] But to me, and we actually spoke about this,
[13311.54s - 13315.18s] you can't get those kinds of numbers with rape.
[13316.38s - 13321.38s] If you want for the empire to propagate the gene,
[13322.06s - 13325.62s] if you were a person that wanted to propagate the genes,
[13325.62s - 13328.30s] you would make sure that all the lands you conquer
[13328.30s - 13331.42s] are stable, flourishing, and happy.
[13331.86s - 13335.70s] Actually, this is much better explained in the paper,
[13335.70s - 13338.62s] indicates this, is better explained by,
[13338.62s - 13343.62s] it was of high value, like social status value,
[13344.30s - 13348.10s] to be associated with the lineage of Genghis Khan.
[13348.10s - 13351.38s] That means that for many generations,
[13351.38s - 13355.90s] people loved the great Khan, the Genghis Khan.
[13355.90s - 13360.62s] In that sense, given how vast the land was,
[13360.62s - 13364.62s] all the transformational effects it has on trade,
[13364.62s - 13368.86s] on culture, and so on, it makes total sense.
[13368.86s - 13373.30s] In fact, the 0.5%, just so people understand,
[13373.30s - 13375.74s] is just male descendants.
[13375.74s - 13380.06s] The way it works, that means, if this paper
[13380.06s - 13382.18s] is at all correct in its estimate,
[13382.18s - 13384.74s] that the number of people descendant,
[13384.74s - 13389.30s] not direct male descendants, but the way trees work
[13389.30s - 13392.22s] is like there's women on each step.
[13392.22s - 13396.66s] So the number of descendants could be much larger than that.
[13396.66s - 13398.50s] So I think that's pretty interesting.
[13398.50s - 13401.34s] And I think there's singular figures like this in history,
[13401.34s - 13405.58s] but none like Genghis.
[13405.58s - 13408.14s] It's interesting, it's fun.
[13408.14s - 13410.46s] Where did they get the DNA from Genghis Khan?
[13410.46s - 13413.90s] Oh yes, so one of the criticism you have is like, well.
[13413.90s - 13417.14s] They don't have one shred of scientific.
[13417.14s - 13418.94s] They're supposed to be scientific.
[13418.94s - 13421.90s] No, they found that the bunch of people are connected.
[13421.90s - 13422.74s] Yes.
[13422.74s - 13423.58s] And then they.
[13423.58s - 13425.74s] No, no, no, no, to one person, to one person.
[13425.74s - 13427.38s] Yes, but they choose Genghis Khan.
[13427.38s - 13428.22s] Right.
[13428.22s - 13430.50s] There's no evidence that it was from him.
[13430.50s - 13431.34s] No evidence.
[13431.34s - 13432.82s] It's from that time.
[13432.82s - 13433.82s] It's one person.
[13433.82s - 13436.38s] But from that time or 200 years before.
[13436.38s - 13438.26s] It could be 200 years before, yeah.
[13438.26s - 13439.10s] Yes, yes.
[13439.10s - 13442.78s] See, I mean, actually, I would like for it to be true
[13442.78s - 13444.34s] in a certain way, I would.
[13444.34s - 13446.86s] And I do think there is a truth there.
[13446.90s - 13450.26s] I think that by attaching it to the name of Genghis Khan,
[13450.26s - 13451.94s] they've done a disservice to themselves,
[13451.94s - 13454.18s] but it gets a lot of publicity and a lot more funding
[13454.18s - 13456.14s] and it's exciting and so on.
[13456.14s - 13458.66s] But I think it's to that Mongol experience.
[13458.66s - 13460.26s] But Genghis Khan's descendants,
[13460.26s - 13465.26s] well, almost everyone categorized and recorded.
[13465.46s - 13467.74s] I mean, he's the largest conqueror in the world.
[13467.74s - 13472.34s] You do not have just children popping up all over the place.
[13472.34s - 13474.02s] He had four wives all the time.
[13474.02s - 13476.34s] He had children with two of them.
[13476.34s - 13477.74s] So it's not a lot of descendants.
[13477.74s - 13481.18s] We know mostly who they are for many generations.
[13481.18s - 13484.90s] His brother Hasser had many more children than he did.
[13484.90s - 13485.98s] Many more.
[13485.98s - 13488.70s] And they caused a lot of problems later on for the empire,
[13488.70s - 13491.02s] too, by rivaling the power.
[13491.02s - 13493.06s] So it could be that one of these other people,
[13493.06s - 13498.06s] Bodin Char Deful, could have been the origin of this.
[13498.18s - 13501.42s] It could have been back well before Genghis Khan.
[13501.42s - 13504.46s] I just don't believe, and in Mongolia today,
[13505.46s - 13509.38s] we have nobody who claims descent from Genghis Khan.
[13509.38s - 13512.74s] Well, claims is a different thing than biology, right?
[13512.74s - 13517.74s] So the reason I say this is this methodology
[13517.86s - 13519.74s] is pretty solid.
[13519.74s - 13524.18s] Oh, I believe that they found some connection of people.
[13524.18s - 13525.10s] Yeah, but it's-
[13525.10s - 13527.98s] They have no evidence that it's really connected
[13527.98s - 13528.90s] to Genghis Khan.
[13528.90s - 13532.14s] I think it may be tangentially connected to him.
[13532.14s - 13535.06s] Yeah, but it's somebody from the Mongolia region.
[13535.06s - 13536.94s] Yeah, I think that's quite possible.
[13537.86s - 13539.66s] But we've already had the Huns come through.
[13539.66s - 13541.50s] We've had all the Turks.
[13541.50s - 13544.82s] Every one of the Turkic nations is descended from Mongolia.
[13544.82s - 13546.38s] They all came out of Mongolia.
[13547.70s - 13548.90s] I mean, you're right.
[13548.90s - 13549.74s] You're right.
[13549.74s - 13553.18s] Well, on the other hand, I wish they could get some proof.
[13553.18s - 13555.50s] I mean, I wish it could be true.
[13555.50s - 13558.34s] I just can't believe it the way it is.
[13558.34s - 13560.50s] We have no DNA.
[13560.50s - 13562.78s] Nobody knows where he went.
[13562.78s - 13564.74s] So they don't know where he's buried.
[13565.78s - 13569.78s] Okay, Genghis Khan said, let my body go.
[13569.78s - 13571.74s] Let my nation live.
[13571.74s - 13575.42s] And he chose to be buried in an unmarked grave.
[13575.42s - 13577.86s] And the Mongols believe very strongly
[13577.86s - 13579.98s] it should always be that way.
[13579.98s - 13583.10s] Most of the Khans who followed him were also buried
[13583.10s - 13584.38s] in a similar way.
[13584.38s - 13585.66s] The Chinese emperors, you know,
[13585.66s - 13588.26s] were buried in very elaborate tombs,
[13588.26s - 13590.30s] but not the Yuan dynasty.
[13590.30s - 13591.46s] No.
[13591.46s - 13595.94s] And so Kubla Khan was buried back with his grandfather
[13595.94s - 13598.10s] in an anonymous grave.
[13598.10s - 13600.38s] And not everyone, like Goik died
[13600.38s - 13602.02s] when he was on campaign towards Russia.
[13602.02s - 13604.66s] He was buried out there.
[13604.66s - 13608.74s] I think his father, Kutai, was also buried out there.
[13608.74s - 13610.14s] That was more their homeland.
[13610.14s - 13613.94s] But many of them were buried with him.
[13613.94s - 13614.78s] And
[13614.78s - 13619.78s] it's known and not known at the same time, you know.
[13625.42s - 13627.94s] It's officially, you should not know it.
[13627.94s - 13629.06s] You cannot know it.
[13629.98s - 13631.62s] It should never be disturbed.
[13631.62s - 13633.50s] He should never be disturbed.
[13633.50s - 13636.06s] We're not gonna have a tour group coming in.
[13636.06s - 13639.18s] But you're saying like the people of Mongolia,
[13639.18s - 13640.30s] they have a sense.
[13640.30s - 13642.70s] They believe he's in a certain place, yes.
[13642.70s - 13644.62s] And they believe they know where the place is.
[13645.50s - 13646.38s] It's sacred.
[13646.38s - 13648.50s] You can do nothing, nothing.
[13649.62s - 13651.10s] Just leave it as it is.
[13651.10s - 13656.10s] That's no roads, no buildings, no killing of animals,
[13656.22s - 13657.74s] no chopping of trees.
[13657.74s - 13659.86s] Nothing can be done.
[13659.86s - 13664.86s] It's a holy land dedicated to him and his family.
[13665.14s - 13667.86s] It's pretty amazing, unmarked grave.
[13667.86s - 13669.34s] Yes.
[13669.34s - 13672.70s] For the greatest conqueror in the history of humanity,
[13674.94s - 13676.10s] for good and for bad,
[13676.10s - 13677.66s] the most impactful,
[13677.66s - 13679.74s] one of the most impactful humans in history.
[13679.74s - 13680.58s] Yes.
[13680.58s - 13682.54s] I believe in his thing about let my nation live,
[13682.54s - 13684.22s] let my body go, let my nation.
[13684.22s - 13685.50s] And I say to people, what,
[13685.50s - 13687.02s] they ask me, well, what did he look like?
[13687.02s - 13688.74s] And I say, well, that portrait was painted
[13688.74s - 13691.34s] 50 years later by somebody who never saw him.
[13691.34s - 13693.46s] And actually, if you look at the portrait
[13693.46s - 13695.38s] of Kubla Khan and Genghis Khan,
[13695.38s - 13698.66s] they look alike except one's old and one's younger.
[13698.66s - 13702.70s] And I think that's because Kubla was trying to establish,
[13702.70s - 13706.30s] he wanted to establish his legitimacy as a real Mongol,
[13706.30s - 13707.14s] that they looked alike,
[13707.14s - 13708.74s] but his grandfather said he didn't.
[13708.74s - 13712.54s] And then Okode Khan and Mung Khan looked different.
[13712.54s - 13713.38s] They looked different.
[13713.38s - 13714.46s] So there was nothing,
[13714.46s - 13716.38s] but I say, if you want to see the face of Genghis Khan,
[13716.38s - 13717.66s] walk in any gear in Mongolia,
[13717.66s - 13718.90s] the first child you see,
[13718.90s - 13720.62s] that's the face of Genghis Khan.
[13720.62s - 13721.58s] It's his nation.
[13721.58s - 13723.42s] He created that nation.
[13723.42s - 13725.14s] That's his face.
[13725.14s - 13727.14s] Does that make you sad that he,
[13727.14s - 13732.14s] that there's no, you know, from his time,
[13733.86s - 13736.14s] capturing of his image,
[13736.14s - 13740.78s] that he really made himself sort of disappear into the land?
[13740.78s - 13742.22s] Does that make you sad?
[13742.22s - 13744.50s] No, not at all.
[13744.50s - 13748.10s] No, because he's everywhere.
[13748.10s - 13750.30s] You know, when you have these clans
[13750.30s - 13752.14s] that are still operating in Afghanistan
[13752.14s - 13755.54s] and the Russians are still using the Yam system,
[13757.26s - 13758.78s] there are many aspects of him
[13758.78s - 13761.10s] that are out there in the world.
[13761.10s - 13764.50s] And I think there, I find personally inspiration
[13764.50s - 13767.10s] the same way that Thomas Jefferson did.
[13767.10s - 13769.90s] He found so much inspiration in the life of Genghis Khan
[13769.90s - 13772.66s] and the books of Genghis Khan that you can still read.
[13772.66s - 13774.86s] He gave copy, he bought so many copies
[13774.86s - 13776.70s] and gave to the Library of Congress,
[13776.70s - 13779.74s] to the Library of Virginia, the University of Virginia,
[13779.74s - 13783.38s] and to his granddaughter, you know.
[13783.38s - 13787.94s] These ideas live on and we still have not fulfilled them.
[13787.94s - 13789.90s] We do not have religious freedom.
[13789.90s - 13792.42s] We do not have the protections for women.
[13792.42s - 13795.66s] We do not have the protections for envoys and ambassadors.
[13796.90s - 13798.98s] The ideas live on and the rulers
[13798.98s - 13801.30s] do not live as the common people.
[13801.30s - 13804.02s] They eat the same food, wear the same clothes,
[13804.02s - 13807.54s] sleep in the same, not a bed in his case,
[13807.54s - 13812.54s] but sleep in the same situation and simple home.
[13812.62s - 13814.10s] No.
[13814.10s - 13818.62s] They have tremendous respect for leaders that live
[13819.90s - 13823.62s] just as the people who they lead.
[13823.62s - 13824.66s] Yes.
[13824.66s - 13826.66s] It's, yeah, mostly not done.
[13827.62s - 13831.14s] But when it is, they have just infinite respect for that.
[13831.14s - 13832.50s] That is the way.
[13832.50s - 13836.70s] What lessons can we learn from Genghis Khan
[13836.70s - 13838.26s] that apply to the modern world?
[13838.26s - 13840.50s] You've already said, religious freedom,
[13840.50s - 13842.26s] some of these ideas.
[13842.98s - 13844.86s] His policy ideas, I think, are important.
[13844.86s - 13848.82s] We can still learn from that about protection of diplomats,
[13848.82s - 13851.94s] not buying and selling women, not kidnapping women,
[13851.94s - 13856.02s] and having religious freedom of individuals.
[13856.02s - 13858.42s] But also, he had interesting things.
[13858.42s - 13862.62s] He had tax-free status for all religions,
[13862.62s - 13865.22s] all physicians, and all teachers.
[13865.22s - 13867.50s] They didn't pay taxes in his empire.
[13868.50s - 13873.38s] As a former teacher, I embraced that idea
[13873.38s - 13875.86s] out of pure greed and self-interest.
[13875.86s - 13878.90s] But it's not, to me, the idea of saving the money.
[13878.90s - 13881.58s] It's the idea of focusing on that
[13881.58s - 13883.90s] as something important for the society.
[13883.90s - 13887.86s] He didn't say tax-free for any other category of people,
[13887.86s - 13890.42s] as I recall, just for those.
[13890.42s - 13893.14s] And he's highlighting the health of the people,
[13893.14s - 13894.42s] the education of the people,
[13894.42s - 13896.94s] and the spirit of the people, the spiritual.
[13897.06s - 13898.38s] That's very important.
[13898.38s - 13902.06s] That's a profound approach to life.
[13903.42s - 13904.62s] So these are policies,
[13904.62s - 13906.90s] and I'm not advocating so much to policies,
[13906.90s - 13909.02s] but I think some of the general principles
[13909.02s - 13913.06s] of being willing to learn from our mistakes.
[13913.06s - 13915.74s] Admit your mistake to yourself,
[13915.74s - 13918.10s] correct it, and go on with your life.
[13919.94s - 13921.94s] All of us say it's important,
[13921.94s - 13924.34s] but we don't do it, for the most part.
[13924.34s - 13928.54s] We don't learn from our failures as much as we think.
[13928.54s - 13932.26s] The other idea of promoting people on ability,
[13933.26s - 13936.94s] I think that's certainly an idea that is very valuable,
[13936.94s - 13939.06s] not in the simple way of meritocracy
[13939.06s - 13940.14s] that we've done it with,
[13940.14s - 13941.70s] oh, if you pass the exam with this score,
[13941.70s - 13943.02s] you get this or that,
[13943.02s - 13946.50s] but really evaluating people and their ability.
[13946.50s - 13950.42s] I think it's a very good thing, not the only thing,
[13950.42s - 13952.46s] but I think it's very important.
[13952.46s - 13954.14s] And even though he failed in the end,
[13954.94s - 13958.34s] and he turned power over to his sons and his family,
[13958.34s - 13961.66s] it's a principle that he lived by most of his life,
[13961.66s - 13964.26s] and we can learn from that principle.
[13965.10s - 13967.42s] The other thing I think is just his global
[13968.54s - 13971.22s] feel for the world, his global understanding.
[13971.22s - 13975.14s] Here was a man who had had no education in any formal sense,
[13975.14s - 13978.30s] and he had this sense that the world should be united.
[13978.30s - 13981.54s] We should have things that unite all people.
[13981.54s - 13982.98s] Everybody should have their own law,
[13982.98s - 13986.22s] but there should be a higher law of heaven
[13986.22s - 13987.46s] that governs people.
[13988.34s - 13990.02s] And this later was translated,
[13990.02s - 13991.38s] everybody should have their own language,
[13991.38s - 13994.38s] but they all write the same alphabet by Kublai Khan.
[13994.38s - 13995.22s] It didn't work.
[13995.22s - 13999.06s] Or his idea, he tried to impose the use of paper currency
[13999.06s - 14004.06s] in Iran, the Persian Ilkhanate, Chinese paper money.
[14004.10s - 14005.10s] It didn't work.
[14005.10s - 14007.06s] The people there weren't used to it.
[14007.06s - 14011.46s] But all this international spirit of their empire,
[14011.50s - 14014.02s] I think that we need today,
[14014.02s - 14017.18s] we talk about, oh, globalization, we're all connected.
[14017.18s - 14018.74s] It's just incredible.
[14018.74s - 14022.02s] And we're more provincial than ever.
[14022.02s - 14023.70s] We are just so provincial,
[14023.70s - 14026.50s] and sometimes we use all this technology
[14026.50s - 14029.62s] to help preserve our provincialism.
[14029.62s - 14032.02s] And we can't think in global terms.
[14032.02s - 14033.90s] We can't think about the world.
[14033.90s - 14038.86s] It's just amazing to me how narrow-minded we are.
[14038.90s - 14043.54s] I also saw the Mongol proverb
[14043.54s - 14045.62s] of if you're afraid, don't do it.
[14045.62s - 14048.02s] If you do it, don't be afraid.
[14048.02s - 14051.34s] That you especially celebrate.
[14051.34s - 14052.98s] I mean, there is something to that.
[14054.38s - 14058.62s] In many ways, Jengis Khan is a representation
[14058.62s - 14063.62s] of a person, like of a self-made man,
[14064.62s - 14066.22s] that person from nothing.
[14067.22s - 14070.62s] Willed an entire empire into existence.
[14070.62s - 14074.82s] Yes, and everything against him that you can think of.
[14074.82s - 14076.22s] Your own family deserting you,
[14076.22s - 14079.74s] your father dying at an early age,
[14079.74s - 14081.42s] all these things like that.
[14081.42s - 14084.54s] But as Jamukha said, he had a good mother
[14084.54s - 14085.78s] and he had a good wife.
[14088.30s - 14091.02s] And there were many crucial points
[14091.02s - 14094.22s] at which it was either his mother or his wife
[14095.22s - 14098.70s] who made the deciding point.
[14098.70s - 14101.22s] His wife, Burshta, was the one who caused
[14101.22s - 14105.22s] the first break with Jamukha to go away.
[14105.22s - 14109.22s] Later on, when the shamans had become too powerful
[14109.22s - 14111.82s] and they had humiliated his younger brother,
[14111.82s - 14114.62s] she was the one who said he had to clamp down
[14114.62s - 14119.62s] on the shamans who were exercising too much power.
[14119.82s - 14122.82s] And she guided him a lot.
[14123.38s - 14126.10s] It cannot be understated how important
[14127.18s - 14131.26s] critical women are in the story of the Mongol Empire.
[14131.26s - 14132.10s] It's fascinating.
[14132.10s - 14134.62s] Yes, and sometimes we could say
[14134.62s - 14135.66s] they're not behind the scenes
[14135.66s - 14137.22s] because they're always out front.
[14137.22s - 14139.46s] In the Mongol court, they always sat up front.
[14139.46s - 14140.42s] They were always out front.
[14140.42s - 14143.94s] And this horrified the Chinese,
[14143.94s - 14147.10s] who were very good Confucius, it horrified the Muslims.
[14147.10s - 14148.94s] It horrified the Christians.
[14149.94s - 14150.78s] They didn't know what to do.
[14150.78s - 14152.98s] They said the women even drink in public.
[14154.26s - 14156.02s] Okay, yeah, they drink in public.
[14159.86s - 14161.14s] So sometimes it was like that,
[14161.14s - 14163.26s] but other times, as with Dorjin,
[14163.26s - 14164.62s] she's actually the ruler.
[14164.62s - 14166.78s] Or the case of his daughters,
[14166.78s - 14171.30s] such as al-Qaibaiq, who ruled over a part of Northern China
[14171.30s - 14173.06s] called the Angut people,
[14173.06s - 14175.54s] and the other daughters who ruled over different...
[14175.54s - 14177.38s] They ruled in their own names.
[14177.38s - 14178.90s] And he's very...
[14178.90s - 14181.74s] This is something about the secret history that upset me.
[14181.74s - 14182.98s] I get to chapter...
[14182.98s - 14184.74s] All the sections are numbered.
[14184.74s - 14188.22s] I get to chapter or number, section 215,
[14189.14s - 14191.70s] and there's only half a sentence left.
[14191.70s - 14194.18s] In 214, he's just awarded a girl.
[14194.18s - 14196.30s] He calls his daughter, so she's probably a clan daughter,
[14196.30s - 14199.22s] but she lives with his mother at this point.
[14200.50s - 14204.34s] His youngest son, Tolo, is only four years old.
[14204.34s - 14207.26s] Tatar comes and Mother Erlum gives him food,
[14207.26s - 14208.74s] because you feed everybody.
[14208.74s - 14211.06s] He realizes this is the mother of Chinggis Khan,
[14211.06s - 14213.10s] and that's the child of Chinggis Khan.
[14213.10s - 14215.74s] He grabs him up and kidnaps him and runs out,
[14215.74s - 14217.30s] and he's holding the child in one hand,
[14217.30s - 14219.70s] and he's pulling out a knife with another hand.
[14219.70s - 14222.94s] Altani raced out, and she grabbed his arm
[14222.94s - 14224.34s] and held it down.
[14224.34s - 14229.34s] And two men, Jebin Jin, they were back behind the gear,
[14229.42s - 14231.30s] slaughtering an ox with an ax,
[14231.30s - 14234.06s] because you have to do it in the shade behind the gear.
[14234.06s - 14235.50s] You don't do it in the light.
[14235.50s - 14236.98s] And so they were back there doing that.
[14236.98s - 14240.18s] And so they raced out with an ax, and they killed the man.
[14240.18s - 14243.02s] And so then Chinggis Khan was awarding everybody
[14243.02s - 14244.26s] for all their great deeds.
[14244.26s - 14247.66s] And Jebin, they wanted to be rewarded
[14247.66s - 14249.54s] for saving the life of Tolo.
[14250.58s - 14253.14s] He said, no, you killed the Tatar.
[14253.14s - 14255.78s] Altani saved his life because she held the hand
[14255.78s - 14260.14s] that had the knife until you got there to kill him.
[14260.14s - 14262.98s] She saved it, and now we reward her.
[14262.98s - 14265.58s] So he's finished that story in 2.14.
[14265.58s - 14266.90s] He gets to 2.15, he says,
[14266.90s - 14269.38s] now let us reward our daughters.
[14270.38s - 14272.34s] It's actually only a phrase of,
[14272.34s - 14275.86s] I said it's a complete sentence, but it's not quite complete.
[14275.86s - 14278.62s] The rest is gone, cut out.
[14280.46s - 14281.34s] It's missing.
[14282.62s - 14284.50s] And I was just so,
[14284.50s - 14286.66s] and I looked at all these different translations
[14286.66s - 14288.02s] of how to different language,
[14288.02s - 14291.70s] and most often they translated it as,
[14291.70s - 14294.90s] and now let us marry our daughters.
[14296.42s - 14298.02s] Oh no, oh no.
[14298.02s - 14301.38s] He was very clear in his wedding speeches to his daughters.
[14301.38s - 14304.26s] I give these people to you to rule.
[14305.42s - 14307.06s] You have three husbands.
[14307.90s - 14312.42s] You have your honor, you have your nation,
[14312.42s - 14315.02s] and you have the man that I give to you.
[14315.02s - 14319.46s] But the man I give to you goes in the army with me
[14319.46s - 14320.70s] and brings his soldiers.
[14320.70s - 14321.54s] Genius.
[14321.54s - 14322.38s] You stay here and rule the people.
[14322.38s - 14323.78s] Brilliant.
[14323.78s - 14325.38s] The Chinese, when they arrived in the court
[14326.18s - 14327.26s] they didn't know what to think.
[14327.26s - 14330.22s] There she is ruling this area of the Angut people.
[14330.22s - 14331.94s] And they said, well, she can read and write,
[14331.94s - 14333.54s] and she's a supreme judge,
[14333.54s - 14335.86s] and she doesn't allow any death sentence
[14335.86s - 14337.26s] without her permission.
[14339.78s - 14342.34s] But they didn't say which languages she could read and write.
[14342.34s - 14344.62s] That has really puzzled me a lot.
[14344.62s - 14346.10s] So you're saying the secret history
[14346.10s - 14349.58s] as we have gotten access to
[14349.58s - 14354.58s] has been edited to remove the significance of women,
[14354.78s - 14357.62s] even though they're still there.
[14357.62s - 14358.62s] In that case.
[14358.62s - 14360.50s] I mean, other cases with his mother,
[14360.50s - 14361.86s] they did not and all.
[14361.86s - 14363.06s] But I think in that case,
[14363.06s - 14367.30s] because what happened is most of these women
[14367.30s - 14370.82s] had few offsprings because their husband was gone to war.
[14370.82s - 14373.42s] And Altani, of course, she married several times,
[14373.42s - 14377.26s] sometimes the sons of the last one, you know.
[14377.26s - 14379.02s] But they were going off to war
[14379.02s - 14380.90s] and they weren't reproducing very well.
[14380.90s - 14383.54s] Only one, Tsetsekin, who was ruling in Siberia,
[14384.46s - 14388.06s] she was the one who had a whole bunch of daughters.
[14388.06s - 14389.30s] They wouldn't be going off to war.
[14389.30s - 14391.74s] And so they actually spread out through the empire
[14391.74s - 14393.82s] and did a lot of, had a lot of power later.
[14393.82s - 14398.22s] But what happened was the area for al-Qaibbaq,
[14398.22s - 14402.46s] for example, was then taken over by Kublai Khan.
[14402.46s - 14405.26s] And then the areas, all the Turkey areas one by one
[14405.26s - 14410.26s] were taken over by their nephews as they died out,
[14410.38s - 14411.94s] not in their own lifetime.
[14411.98s - 14413.66s] They didn't kill the women off.
[14413.66s - 14418.22s] But as they died out, the men took it over.
[14418.22s - 14420.14s] And so then they just wanted to kind of erase it.
[14420.14s - 14422.10s] It's like, no, Northern China,
[14422.10s - 14424.26s] even though it was ruled by Tsorakhtani,
[14424.26s - 14426.26s] it always was Mongol.
[14426.26s - 14428.62s] She was ruling because her husband was Mongol
[14428.62s - 14429.86s] and her sons were Mongol,
[14429.86s - 14432.06s] therefore they had the right to rule it.
[14432.06s - 14434.34s] So they cut out the women for those reasons.
[14434.34s - 14438.10s] I think anytime it threatened the power of a particular man.
[14438.10s - 14439.34s] Then there were other little things
[14439.34s - 14440.94s] that are added in there.
[14440.94s - 14442.34s] Sometimes you can find a phrase
[14442.34s - 14446.74s] and it's like that phrase was not in the original.
[14446.74s - 14448.22s] Yeah.
[14448.22s - 14450.34s] In studying human history,
[14450.34s - 14453.10s] what have you learned about human nature
[14453.10s - 14455.98s] and just the trajectory of humanity
[14455.98s - 14459.18s] throughout the past several millennia?
[14459.18s - 14463.06s] I tend to have a certain love for individuals and persons,
[14463.06s - 14465.86s] but not a love for people in general,
[14465.86s - 14468.54s] and especially not for institutions.
[14468.54s - 14472.54s] I tend to have a great suspicion
[14472.54s - 14473.98s] about almost everything
[14473.98s - 14477.62s] and mistrust in institutions over and over.
[14477.62s - 14480.14s] And I think that's my own prejudice.
[14480.14s - 14483.10s] And then I find reasons to support that.
[14483.10s - 14484.82s] And Chinggis Khan was very good
[14484.82s - 14488.26s] at destroying a lot of institutions
[14488.26s - 14491.94s] or bringing them to heel within his empire.
[14491.94s - 14493.98s] So then I like that and I stress that
[14493.98s - 14495.74s] and I see those things.
[14497.14s - 14498.02s] I think that's one thing,
[14498.02s - 14502.06s] but other things that I learned from the Mongol people
[14502.06s - 14504.74s] in general, not just about their history and all,
[14504.74s - 14506.70s] but how it's possible to live
[14506.70s - 14509.22s] for thousands of years in a place
[14509.22s - 14513.02s] that for many people is not the most beautiful in the world.
[14513.02s - 14514.50s] It's austere.
[14514.50s - 14518.02s] You have a band of mountains and with some trees
[14518.02s - 14519.62s] and then big band of steppe
[14519.62s - 14523.54s] and then a big band of sand, gravel desert, the Gobi.
[14523.54s - 14525.78s] And for many people, it's not appealing.
[14525.78s - 14526.62s] It's just open.
[14526.62s - 14528.06s] There's too much space.
[14528.06s - 14529.94s] It's like, we need to build something over here.
[14529.94s - 14531.94s] Boy, you could have a condo right there.
[14531.94s - 14532.82s] We could have a building.
[14532.82s - 14533.90s] We could sell them off.
[14535.90s - 14537.98s] They haven't given into that.
[14537.98s - 14540.22s] They really value their country.
[14540.22s - 14542.34s] They protect their country.
[14542.34s - 14546.22s] Even now only 1% is privately owned.
[14546.22s - 14547.22s] They keep it down.
[14547.22s - 14549.78s] And in Mongolian records,
[14549.78s - 14552.02s] farm and city count as one category
[14552.02s - 14554.54s] because it's settled people.
[14554.54s - 14555.38s] It doesn't matter.
[14555.98s - 14556.82s] You settle on a farm, you settle in a city.
[14556.82s - 14559.06s] Settled people, one category.
[14559.06s - 14563.54s] And they lived there in this land
[14564.82s - 14567.22s] that Chinggis Khan would return to and love.
[14568.42s - 14569.98s] If he returned to the capital city,
[14569.98s - 14571.50s] he would not know where he was.
[14571.50s - 14572.78s] He would have no idea.
[14572.78s - 14574.10s] And all the people would just say,
[14574.10s - 14575.14s] I'll be Mongolian.
[14575.14s - 14576.18s] I'm Mongolian.
[14576.18s - 14577.02s] Yeah, I'm Mongol.
[14577.02s - 14577.98s] I have the hat.
[14577.98s - 14579.98s] I have the bell buckle.
[14579.98s - 14582.94s] I have all the tail that's all embroidered.
[14582.94s - 14584.34s] Yeah, I'm Mongol.
[14584.34s - 14587.62s] And Chinggis Khan would say, where's your horse?
[14587.62s - 14589.18s] Oh, keep it in the countryside.
[14590.22s - 14593.78s] But he wouldn't recognize the city,
[14593.78s - 14596.78s] but it's still his country, his people.
[14596.78s - 14599.42s] They worship him in a literal sense,
[14599.42s - 14603.34s] not the way we would worship God asking for favors,
[14603.34s - 14606.46s] but in the sense of worshiping him with praise.
[14606.46s - 14609.34s] They have so many songs to praise him.
[14609.34s - 14611.34s] And about half of the hip hop in the country
[14611.34s - 14612.86s] is in praise of Chinggis Khan.
[14613.58s - 14615.90s] You know, it's something we can't understand
[14615.90s - 14619.22s] because when we pray, we're usually saying,
[14619.22s - 14621.02s] oh, thank you God for this and that and the other,
[14621.02s - 14622.46s] and you're so wonderful and I love you.
[14622.46s - 14624.06s] So would you please give me,
[14624.06s - 14625.18s] and would you please do this,
[14625.18s - 14627.86s] and would you please stop this pain in my knee?
[14627.86s - 14630.18s] We're asking for things all over the place.
[14630.18s - 14632.46s] But Chinggis Khan, no, no.
[14632.46s - 14634.22s] No one ever asks for anything.
[14634.22s - 14636.22s] They just honor him.
[14636.22s - 14639.26s] They just praise him and honor him.
[14639.30s - 14643.06s] If I wanted to visit Mongolia, what would you recommend?
[14643.06s - 14645.06s] What's the right way?
[14645.06s - 14646.62s] Well, start with my home.
[14646.62s - 14647.46s] Let's start there.
[14647.46s - 14648.30s] You come over there.
[14648.30s - 14650.58s] It's a nice valley.
[14650.58s - 14652.42s] I mean, I have a nice valley there.
[14656.10s - 14658.86s] I think almost any direction you go outside of the city
[14658.86s - 14661.06s] is going to be interesting.
[14661.06s - 14664.74s] It kind of depends a little bit on your purpose.
[14664.74s - 14666.54s] Most people go south to the Gobi
[14666.54s - 14668.06s] and they do a loop to the Gobi
[14668.06s - 14669.74s] and around to Karakorum,
[14669.74s - 14673.18s] Hachor in the old capital from Agudahan,
[14673.18s - 14675.42s] but it was abandoned by Kublai Khan.
[14675.42s - 14677.18s] And then they circle back to the city
[14677.18s - 14682.18s] and they may stop off to see what we call Preshwalski,
[14682.18s - 14686.42s] the wild horse, but they call Kach Taki to see the Taki,
[14686.42s - 14689.18s] or they may go up to Hufskul Lake,
[14689.18s - 14692.74s] a big beautiful lake, somewhat like Baikal, but much smaller.
[14692.74s - 14695.14s] So that's a beautiful trip.
[14695.14s - 14697.10s] If you want to see the more Turkic area
[14697.10s - 14698.82s] where they hunt with eagles,
[14698.82s - 14702.18s] the far west is where the Kazakh people live.
[14702.18s - 14705.74s] And the mountains are absolutely incredibly beautiful.
[14705.74s - 14709.98s] Most mountains in Mongolia are gentle, beautiful, but gentle.
[14709.98s - 14712.74s] The farther west you go, the more dramatic they become,
[14712.74s - 14716.26s] the more pointed and peaked and snow covered.
[14716.26s - 14718.74s] Then if you go to the eastern Mongolia,
[14718.74s - 14721.14s] it tends to be very flat.
[14721.14s - 14724.10s] There are massive, massive flocks of cranes
[14724.10s - 14725.54s] that come in every year.
[14725.54s - 14727.62s] Millions and millions of cranes.
[14727.62s - 14731.74s] There are also tundra swans that come in and golden ducks
[14731.74s - 14735.86s] and all kinds of beautiful birds out there.
[14735.86s - 14738.66s] And so each area has something special.
[14738.66s - 14742.06s] If you want particularly the history of Chinggis Khan,
[14742.06s - 14745.82s] the Mongolians love him, they worship him,
[14745.82s - 14748.70s] but they don't do too much to capitalize
[14748.70s - 14752.10s] on his home area, the Hinti.
[14752.10s - 14753.70s] You can go to the Hinti.
[14753.70s - 14755.18s] There are areas you cannot go to,
[14755.18s - 14757.62s] large, large areas, it's forbidden.
[14757.62s - 14760.54s] But you can go, but they don't capitalize like,
[14760.54s - 14761.74s] this is the place.
[14761.74s - 14766.06s] No, they go there themselves out of respect.
[14768.10s - 14772.90s] But the only one place they built this statue of him,
[14772.90s - 14776.38s] which is the largest equestrian statue in the world,
[14776.38s - 14779.10s] but it's the place where they say he found his whip,
[14780.06s - 14782.46s] which is when he was coming back
[14782.46s - 14786.38s] from being at the camp of asking Orgal Khan
[14786.38s - 14789.18s] or Torgal Khan or Wang Khan to support him.
[14789.18s - 14791.58s] And he's coming back to his family.
[14791.58s - 14793.82s] And on the way, he supposedly found a whip there,
[14793.82s - 14796.94s] which is just a small stick with a couple of strands
[14796.94s - 14800.10s] of rawhide at the end of it that's used.
[14800.10s - 14802.90s] But for the Mongolians, it's a symbolic thing
[14802.90s - 14805.34s] because obviously it's used for the horse.
[14805.34s - 14808.38s] But for the Mongols, your destiny,
[14809.34s - 14814.34s] yourself is your himor, your wind horse
[14814.62s - 14816.38s] that lives inside of you.
[14816.38s - 14820.54s] Your wind horse that guides you and gives you opportunities.
[14820.54s - 14824.70s] But it's up to you to ride that wind horse.
[14824.70s - 14827.22s] It's up to you to use the wind horse,
[14827.22s - 14829.58s] not to just go wild with the wind horse.
[14829.58s - 14834.02s] And so I think it's at that crucial moment,
[14834.02s - 14837.66s] he's on his way back home and to go with Jamukha
[14837.66s - 14841.70s] and the other soldiers to the market to rescue Birsta.
[14841.70s - 14845.58s] And so symbolically, he found a whip there.
[14845.58s - 14849.22s] But I think it means that he found the way
[14849.22s - 14852.86s] to control his destiny, his fate.
[14852.86s - 14856.34s] That's very important, very important.
[14856.34s - 14859.70s] And that he did, that was the beginning of everything.
[14859.70s - 14862.18s] Yes, and it's symbolized in that statue.
[14862.18s - 14864.06s] Some people think that he's holding this stick,
[14864.06s - 14866.06s] that it's a baton or something like that,
[14866.14s - 14871.14s] but no, it's that what they call a whip, to shoot.
[14871.34s - 14873.86s] We've talked a lot about the past.
[14873.86s - 14876.18s] If we look out into the future,
[14876.18s - 14881.18s] what gives you hope for human civilization, for us humans?
[14882.02s - 14883.02s] Well, almost every day,
[14883.02s - 14886.02s] I'm totally dissatisfied with everything on earth.
[14886.02s - 14890.30s] You know, it's just that kind of old man,
[14890.30s - 14891.74s] blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[14891.74s - 14893.14s] What are they talking about?
[14893.14s - 14894.30s] My grandchildren are talking to me,
[14894.30s - 14896.26s] I don't understand a word they say.
[14896.26s - 14897.86s] What are they, what?
[14897.86s - 14899.22s] And who are they talking about?
[14899.22s - 14901.98s] I never heard of this, you know, it's kind of like that.
[14901.98s - 14903.42s] And who's running for office?
[14903.42s - 14906.78s] Oh my God, oh my God, you know, it's everything like that.
[14906.78s - 14910.66s] But then almost every day, I meet somebody,
[14911.66s - 14916.46s] just one person, you know, who gives you some kind of hope.
[14916.46s - 14919.94s] You just see somebody doing something nice and,
[14919.94s - 14922.06s] or they do something nice for you.
[14922.06s - 14925.86s] And I do find in Asia that happens a lot, you know,
[14925.86s - 14930.78s] that people just do nice things for old people every day.
[14930.78s - 14935.58s] And so then my dissatisfaction
[14935.58s - 14937.42s] with all the big things in the world
[14937.42s - 14940.22s] and the way my grandchildren talk
[14940.22s - 14943.22s] and the way young people are,
[14943.22s - 14946.66s] and then I see something like that.
[14946.66s - 14949.22s] And often it's something with the young people,
[14949.22s - 14950.78s] something that the young people do.
[14950.78s - 14955.22s] And in an Asian, they're always bringing me things.
[14955.22s - 14957.26s] They bring me dried curds,
[14957.26s - 14959.50s] they bring me strawberries that they picked
[14959.50s - 14961.54s] in the forest in the summer,
[14961.54s - 14966.54s] or they bring the pine nuts that they found,
[14966.78s - 14971.54s] or they bring me the milk in various forms, or yogurt.
[14971.54s - 14973.90s] Oh yeah, everybody thinks, you got to eat the yogurt.
[14973.90s - 14975.26s] This is from my grandmother
[14975.26s - 14978.54s] and all the other yogurt in the world is not good.
[14978.70s - 14982.14s] My grandmother, she knows how to make the best yogurt ever.
[14983.50s - 14986.54s] And so over and over and over,
[14986.54s - 14991.06s] I find despite my all intentions to be in a bad mood,
[14992.82s - 14996.42s] somebody spoils you with these little nice acts
[14996.42s - 15000.14s] that are really very touching, very touching.
[15000.14s - 15001.02s] Yeah, and it reminds you
[15001.02s - 15002.78s] that there's that little flame of goodness
[15002.78s - 15004.82s] that burns in everybody.
[15004.82s - 15007.78s] I believe that that on the whole
[15007.78s - 15012.22s] will keep humanity flourishing,
[15012.22s - 15016.26s] keep evolving and changing towards something better
[15016.26s - 15017.50s] with every generation.
[15017.50s - 15018.34s] Yes.
[15020.54s - 15023.02s] The people in Mongolia take such good care of me
[15023.02s - 15025.18s] all the time, all the time.
[15025.18s - 15028.34s] And I think my wife had MS,
[15028.34s - 15030.14s] I've talked about this before sometimes,
[15030.14s - 15033.06s] she had MS and slowly declined for many years,
[15033.06s - 15035.54s] becoming paralyzed, not able to speak,
[15035.58s - 15038.78s] not able to control her movements or anything.
[15039.70s - 15043.30s] And we lived half the year still in Mongolia.
[15043.30s - 15045.50s] Part of it was because the climate and the altitude
[15045.50s - 15048.30s] were better for her situation.
[15048.30s - 15051.50s] It was very helpful for her, but also the people.
[15051.50s - 15055.06s] There was a poor country, the sidewalks are broken,
[15055.06s - 15057.34s] everything's not working.
[15057.34s - 15059.26s] But I would go out with her in a wheelchair alone
[15059.26s - 15060.94s] and I knew that every bump,
[15061.94s - 15065.46s] some arm would pick her up, pick up the wheelchair
[15065.46s - 15068.46s] and lift her over that and not make me do it.
[15068.46s - 15070.06s] We could go to the opera and you had to go up
[15070.06s - 15072.90s] this magnificent set of Soviet stairs
[15072.90s - 15075.66s] to get to the opera, we would go.
[15075.66s - 15076.74s] And I had no worries.
[15076.74s - 15079.38s] I knew two guys would come from one side,
[15079.38s - 15081.10s] two guys from the other side, they would carry on.
[15081.10s - 15083.46s] And they do not say, excuse me, may I help you?
[15083.46s - 15086.78s] They do not wait for you to say thank you, nothing.
[15086.78s - 15089.50s] They just do it and they walk away.
[15089.70s - 15091.46s] They have such respect.
[15091.46s - 15094.58s] Singers would come there all the time to sing,
[15094.58s - 15097.30s] to warm up the house for my wife.
[15097.30s - 15100.42s] And even dancers would come sometimes to dance
[15100.42s - 15102.78s] or play the horse head fiddle,
[15102.78s - 15107.30s] to play that, to warm up the house for her.
[15107.30s - 15111.90s] To see how they treated a totally disabled person.
[15113.06s - 15116.62s] And if I was feeding my wife and anybody saw it,
[15116.62s - 15118.26s] they would come and immediately take over
[15118.26s - 15120.66s] and start feeding her in their place.
[15120.66s - 15121.74s] Children would come up to her.
[15121.74s - 15123.94s] In America, they're often afraid
[15123.94s - 15126.42s] that she's somebody in a wheelchair.
[15126.42s - 15129.06s] They just kind of look, they don't know what to do.
[15129.06s - 15131.42s] But over there, the children would always come to her,
[15131.42s - 15133.66s] always, they were very kind.
[15133.66s - 15136.78s] You just learn something about the people.
[15136.78s - 15139.82s] And living there in a country where you,
[15139.82s - 15142.14s] out in the countryside, you come to a gare,
[15142.14s - 15144.10s] you never ask for permission to go in.
[15144.10s - 15147.54s] You certainly don't knock on the doorframe, that's no.
[15147.58s - 15149.82s] That's hugely offensive.
[15149.82s - 15152.78s] And you ask, it's like insulting the people, like what?
[15152.78s - 15154.42s] You're not good hospital people,
[15154.42s - 15156.06s] I have to ask you for something?
[15156.06s - 15160.42s] No, you walk in and you sit down and they fix food for you.
[15161.66s - 15164.62s] It's an incredible thing.
[15164.62s - 15167.74s] And these are the things that give me hope.
[15167.74s - 15170.98s] It's no institution in the world, not the big things
[15170.98s - 15174.82s] and not the pop culture and not all the platitudes.
[15174.82s - 15178.42s] Oh my God, save us from the platitudes of modern life.
[15182.42s - 15184.42s] It's the family that will fix tea for you
[15184.42s - 15186.70s] in two in the morning because there was a flash flood
[15186.70s - 15190.30s] and you got stuck and now you're cold and wet
[15190.30s - 15192.86s] and they build a fire and take care of you.
[15192.86s - 15194.98s] Or you just show up and you make camp somewhere
[15194.98s - 15196.62s] if you have your own tent.
[15196.62s - 15198.82s] And I swear within one hour,
[15198.82s - 15202.14s] some child is gonna be there with water and milk.
[15202.14s - 15204.30s] You think, where did you come from?
[15204.30s - 15205.66s] But the mother sends them over.
[15205.66s - 15207.74s] Oh, there's somebody over there in the forest.
[15207.74s - 15209.74s] They believe that they're obligated
[15209.74s - 15211.46s] to take care of one another.
[15211.46s - 15215.18s] Anybody in your area, you take care of them.
[15215.18s - 15219.46s] And things like that, individuals do give me hope.
[15220.78s - 15223.98s] People one by one or a few at a time,
[15223.98s - 15226.34s] even though I'm lost in the modern world.
[15229.34s - 15230.78s] I'm glad you find your way.
[15230.78s - 15235.78s] You mentioned that your wife is no longer with us.
[15238.06s - 15241.18s] What's a favorite memory you have with her?
[15243.46s - 15245.26s] Well, I could say a favorite picture
[15245.26s - 15250.26s] is a lake we used to go to called Uginur in the middle.
[15250.94s - 15255.94s] And somebody, a very nice friend took a picture of us
[15257.10s - 15257.94s] towards the end.
[15257.94s - 15260.42s] We're just sitting there watching the sunset over the lake
[15260.42s - 15263.22s] that we've been to many, many times in life.
[15263.22s - 15267.22s] And she's holding, we're holding hands.
[15267.22s - 15268.86s] She's in the chair paralyzed.
[15268.86s - 15272.70s] And we're just sitting there staring off in the distance.
[15272.70s - 15274.66s] That's one of my favorites.
[15274.66s - 15279.66s] But with my wife, I was just blessed
[15280.82s - 15284.78s] with a good wife that was exciting.
[15284.78s - 15286.06s] She was the most beautiful woman
[15286.06s - 15288.14s] I had ever met in my whole life.
[15288.14s - 15289.22s] She was smart.
[15289.22s - 15291.30s] She would talk to people about anything.
[15291.30s - 15293.66s] She'd talk about jazz or physics or art.
[15293.66s - 15296.06s] I mean, my life is so small and narrow,
[15296.06s - 15301.06s] but my wife, she's the one who gave me a life.
[15302.94s - 15304.74s] The truth is very odd.
[15304.74s - 15305.86s] People don't believe sometimes.
[15305.86s - 15308.66s] I failed English in college.
[15308.66s - 15310.46s] I barely got in college.
[15310.46s - 15311.54s] Nobody in my family,
[15311.54s - 15314.10s] I'd grown up with my grandparents mostly countryside
[15314.10s - 15315.58s] and they had third grade education.
[15315.58s - 15316.98s] My father had seventh grade.
[15316.98s - 15320.18s] I would live with him after the grandparents died
[15320.18s - 15321.38s] and my mother.
[15322.26s - 15325.34s] There was no big education there in the family,
[15325.34s - 15327.06s] but I somehow got to college.
[15327.06s - 15328.74s] My father told me to go.
[15328.74s - 15330.38s] He didn't want me to go to the war in Vietnam.
[15330.38s - 15333.38s] So he volunteered to go because there was the rule
[15333.38s - 15336.30s] that they couldn't send two people from one family
[15336.30s - 15337.70s] against their will.
[15337.70s - 15339.98s] That was mainly designed to protect brothers,
[15339.98s - 15341.38s] but he could go as the father
[15341.38s - 15343.22s] and then I could go to college.
[15343.22s - 15345.50s] So I got to college and I can't say,
[15345.50s - 15348.30s] oh, I was drinking and having a party and not serious.
[15348.30s - 15351.42s] No, I was trying like hell to pass that course.
[15351.42s - 15353.06s] I failed English.
[15353.06s - 15354.66s] I failed it.
[15354.66s - 15357.22s] And this was just a huge shame to me.
[15357.22s - 15359.74s] In fact, after one year I was put on probation
[15359.74s - 15361.06s] to be kicked out of the school.
[15361.06s - 15363.70s] My grades were so low overall.
[15365.54s - 15368.18s] So it took me a long time to confess this to my wife
[15368.18s - 15369.54s] after we met.
[15369.54s - 15373.78s] I met her, I briefly had known her in high school,
[15373.78s - 15375.54s] but just not well or anything.
[15375.54s - 15378.62s] But anyway, we met later and I told her
[15378.62s - 15379.62s] and she just looked at me.
[15379.62s - 15383.06s] She said, what does a professor know?
[15383.06s - 15384.86s] It's just a professor.
[15384.86s - 15386.50s] You can write anything you want.
[15386.50s - 15389.74s] And she had the power to make me believe everything she said.
[15389.74s - 15392.10s] I don't care what she said, I would believe it.
[15392.10s - 15393.90s] And I would say, yeah, that's right.
[15393.90s - 15395.58s] That's just a professor.
[15395.58s - 15396.42s] Yeah.
[15398.54s - 15401.74s] She inspired me, but she also,
[15401.74s - 15404.34s] she supported me all the way through graduate school.
[15404.34s - 15406.02s] She was taking some courses of her own
[15406.02s - 15408.30s] and she was doing graduate work.
[15408.30s - 15410.70s] But she inspired me, but she told me,
[15411.98s - 15413.70s] I said, I want to write for more people
[15413.70s - 15415.06s] than just for other scholars.
[15415.06s - 15417.14s] I've done this dissertation, a PhD,
[15417.14s - 15422.14s] and it's as dry as the Sahara, the Sargobi Desert.
[15422.26s - 15425.78s] And I didn't know what to do.
[15425.78s - 15429.94s] And she said, just tell the story to me,
[15429.94s - 15431.90s] but I can't see you while you tell it.
[15431.90s - 15434.94s] You're on the radio and I'm listening in my car,
[15434.94s - 15436.50s] driving somewhere.
[15436.50s - 15439.30s] Just tell the story to me.
[15439.30s - 15442.94s] And to this day, almost every word I write,
[15442.94s - 15447.22s] as always, just tell the story to her
[15447.22s - 15448.62s] the way that she would like it.
[15448.62s - 15450.94s] And I always read the books to her.
[15451.86s - 15455.46s] Even she couldn't comprehend too much, you know,
[15455.46s - 15457.38s] but she just loved hearing the book
[15458.34s - 15460.54s] because it was mine.
[15460.54s - 15463.62s] And, you know, in the last years of her life,
[15463.62s - 15467.26s] I gave up the teaching and we went back
[15467.26s - 15469.82s] to our original home in South Carolina.
[15469.82s - 15471.82s] And I said, okay, we're just going to live here
[15471.82s - 15474.42s] and watch the ocean and do things like that
[15474.42s - 15476.82s] and just be worthless teenagers.
[15477.90s - 15480.94s] And my wife used to have episodes of clarity.
[15482.06s - 15485.30s] I have no idea what caused, I mean, it might be two hours,
[15485.30s - 15487.50s] it might be seven or eight hours.
[15487.50s - 15489.18s] And we would talk a lot.
[15490.50s - 15493.62s] And so one time she said to me, she said,
[15496.54s - 15499.14s] this disease is going to take my life,
[15499.14s - 15501.42s] but it's taking your life.
[15501.42s - 15505.94s] She said, you gave up teaching and you gave up writing.
[15505.94s - 15510.02s] And she said, how do you expect me to die in peace
[15510.02s - 15514.62s] if I know that you gave up everything to this disease?
[15516.30s - 15517.78s] She said, you should write.
[15518.86s - 15523.18s] And so every single day we sat together by the water,
[15523.18s - 15526.46s] I mean, by the window, I moved it into the dining room,
[15526.46s - 15529.30s] overlooking the water, we sat there at the desk
[15529.30s - 15532.06s] and she sat in a wheelchair next to me.
[15532.06s - 15534.42s] And sometimes we would play a little soft music
[15534.42s - 15536.22s] in the background a little bit.
[15536.22s - 15538.42s] And for the most part, she couldn't talk,
[15538.42s - 15542.66s] but she liked to just sit there beside me working.
[15543.02s - 15546.14s] And she knew that she was inspiration.
[15546.14s - 15550.06s] She knew, she was the battery that kept me going, you know?
[15552.10s - 15557.10s] How on earth I ever had a wife like that, I don't know.
[15557.90s - 15560.86s] That's beautiful, Jack, that's really beautiful.
[15560.86s - 15564.14s] You know, I just hit the jackpot with her.
[15565.10s - 15567.66s] And I see so many people that get by
[15567.66s - 15571.94s] and they even like each other or they're friends or something.
[15571.94s - 15575.54s] But in my life, there was one person.
[15575.54s - 15577.54s] I love my children, I still do.
[15577.54s - 15580.70s] I love my grandchildren, even though I don't understand them.
[15580.70s - 15585.70s] But there's one person in my life and that was my wife.
[15586.74s - 15591.74s] 44 years and her funeral was on our anniversary.
[15591.82s - 15595.10s] I mean, that's just the way life works out, you know?
[15595.10s - 15597.38s] But I was very lucky, very lucky.
[15598.38s - 15603.38s] If the two of you lived and met a few centuries ago,
[15604.42s - 15607.90s] I might be reading a history book about you conquering.
[15607.90s - 15608.74s] No, no, no.
[15608.74s - 15611.98s] And if she said, you know, you should do this.
[15613.18s - 15614.02s] Maybe you would be dead.
[15614.02s - 15616.06s] If she said it, I probably would have believed it.
[15616.06s - 15617.30s] Exactly, exactly.
[15617.30s - 15620.02s] She was too busy enjoying the world, you know?
[15620.02s - 15625.02s] And, you know, in her final, I could not ask her questions
[15625.54s - 15627.62s] and I would not say, oh, you remember that?
[15627.62s - 15628.86s] No, I never would say that
[15628.86s - 15630.82s] because I knew she couldn't remember.
[15630.82s - 15635.34s] But when she was being restless or something in the night,
[15635.34s - 15638.82s] I used to recite scenes from our life
[15638.82s - 15642.22s] and just give the scene without saying, do you remember?
[15642.22s - 15644.26s] But the last night, I certainly didn't know
[15644.26s - 15646.86s] that she was going, but it was a rough night.
[15646.86s - 15651.86s] And we went back to the first night that we had in Moscow.
[15652.50s - 15655.94s] The first night that we had in Moscow.
[15655.94s - 15658.50s] We came in December in the winter
[15658.50s - 15660.86s] and the snow was so beautiful and white
[15660.86s - 15663.26s] and the yellow lights shining on it.
[15664.62s - 15669.38s] And then the most beautiful night, we went to the Bolshoi
[15669.38s - 15673.78s] and she had this elegant blue wool coat
[15673.78s - 15678.46s] from her grandmother from the 1920s with a huge,
[15678.46s - 15683.46s] it's so ironic, it was a blue wolf, but it's gray blue.
[15684.70s - 15689.06s] Like the Mongol had gray blue collar, this huge collar.
[15689.06s - 15690.62s] She just looked like a movie star
[15690.62s - 15692.46s] from the 20s or something.
[15692.46s - 15696.18s] And we went to see Maya Plisetskaya
[15696.18s - 15698.50s] and it was one of the most beautiful nights.
[15698.50s - 15703.50s] But her last night, I told her that story again,
[15705.22s - 15707.42s] you know, of all the details.
[15707.42s - 15709.02s] I'd gone through it many times,
[15709.02s - 15710.82s] but her coat from her grandmother,
[15710.82s - 15714.10s] whom she loved very much and the snow and the yellow lights.
[15714.10s - 15715.50s] And we arrived at night,
[15715.50s - 15717.22s] because of course the flight was late.
[15717.22s - 15721.38s] And then the next night going to the Bolshoi
[15721.38s - 15724.50s] and all those beautiful things from Russia.
[15727.02s - 15728.70s] So that was it.
[15728.70s - 15730.06s] She was an inspiration.
[15730.06s - 15733.82s] I have many, many nights or many days of great memories.
[15733.82s - 15735.26s] You're gonna make me cry, Jack.
[15735.26s - 15736.10s] Oh no.
[15736.10s - 15737.26s] That was beautiful.
[15738.10s - 15739.70s] You're a beautiful human being.
[15739.70s - 15742.50s] It's really an honor to talk to you.
[15742.50s - 15747.42s] This was such a fascinating journey through human history
[15747.42s - 15750.26s] about one of the most impactful humans in human history.
[15750.26s - 15751.98s] Well, I thank you very much.
[15751.98s - 15753.62s] And the amount of research,
[15753.62s - 15757.34s] when I realized how much research you had done,
[15757.34s - 15759.26s] I felt like you're gonna know things I don't know
[15759.26s - 15761.62s] and you're gonna trick me and pull something out
[15761.62s - 15764.26s] and I'm gonna be shamed in front of the whole world.
[15764.26s - 15766.14s] There's only one piece of research left
[15766.14s - 15770.06s] is me going to Mongolia and riding there on the step.
[15770.06s - 15772.86s] That would be incredible.
[15772.86s - 15773.98s] Come, come.
[15773.98s - 15774.82s] I will.
[15774.82s - 15776.82s] Thank you so much for talking to me, Jack.
[15776.82s - 15778.42s] Thank you.
[15778.42s - 15779.82s] Thanks for listening to this conversation
[15779.82s - 15781.22s] with Jack Weatherford.
[15781.22s - 15782.46s] To support this podcast,

[15784.82s - 15787.82s] and consider subscribing to this channel.
[15788.66s - 15790.74s] And now let me answer some questions
[15790.74s - 15794.14s] and try to articulate some things I've been thinking about.
[15794.14s - 15795.70s] If you would like to submit questions,
[15795.70s - 15798.30s] including in audio and video form,
[15798.30s - 15801.10s] go to lexfreedman.com slash AMA.
[15801.10s - 15804.18s] Or if you want to contact me for other reasons,
[15804.18s - 15807.26s] go to lexfreedman.com slash contact.
[15807.26s - 15809.58s] And now allow me to make a few comments
[15809.58s - 15813.82s] on the ever evolving moral landscape of human civilization
[15813.82s - 15817.58s] throughout our 10,000 year history.
[15817.58s - 15819.86s] I was listening to Dan Carlin's excellent,
[15819.86s - 15821.66s] eye-opening five and a half hour episode
[15821.66s - 15825.06s] of Hardcore History titled, Human Resources.
[15825.10s - 15826.98s] It covered the topic of slavery,
[15826.98s - 15831.14s] the Atlantic slave trade to be exact.
[15831.14s - 15833.50s] One of the lessons I took from this episode
[15833.50s - 15837.50s] is that the long arc of history is full of atrocities
[15837.50s - 15840.34s] as we modern day humans understand them
[15840.34s - 15843.90s] with the wisdom of time and moral progress.
[15843.90s - 15847.38s] But during each period of history, as Dan documents,
[15847.38s - 15850.10s] it was difficult for the majority of people to see
[15850.10s - 15853.46s] just where the line between good and evil is.
[15853.46s - 15857.70s] We humans, after all, forever like to weave a story
[15857.70s - 15860.02s] in which we are the good guys.
[15861.26s - 15864.10s] Listening to Dan discuss and later myself reading
[15864.10s - 15867.98s] firsthand accounts of slaves, of torture, of rape,
[15867.98s - 15872.86s] of separation of families is incomprehensibly heartbreaking.
[15872.86s - 15873.90s] By the way, in this topic,
[15873.90s - 15875.70s] firsthand accounts of slavery could be read
[15875.70s - 15879.18s] in Slave Narratives, a folk history of slavery
[15879.18s - 15883.02s] in the United States from interviews with former slaves.
[15883.06s - 15884.70s] I can recommend the book that I've been reading,
[15884.70s - 15886.70s] which is Voices from Slavery,
[15886.70s - 15889.66s] 100 Authentic Slave Narratives.
[15889.66s - 15893.82s] It all seems deeply and obviously wrong by today's standards,
[15893.82s - 15898.82s] but slavery was seen as normal through most of human history.
[15899.30s - 15901.66s] Thomas Jefferson, the man who wrote,
[15901.66s - 15903.82s] all men are created equal,
[15903.82s - 15906.14s] which I think is one of the most powerful lines
[15906.14s - 15907.94s] in all of human history.
[15907.94s - 15910.46s] He himself was a slave owner,
[15910.46s - 15913.94s] making him a fascinating case study of contradictions.
[15914.86s - 15917.02s] In fact, there's evidence that Thomas Jefferson
[15917.02s - 15918.82s] drew from Genghis Khan's ideas
[15918.82s - 15921.10s] about the importance of religious freedom,
[15922.34s - 15926.06s] pulling as he did foundational ideas of human freedom
[15926.06s - 15928.86s] from the jaws of deep history.
[15928.86s - 15931.86s] And Dan in his episode documents these contradictions
[15931.86s - 15933.70s] and complexities quite well,
[15933.70s - 15936.38s] the full range of human psychology involved,
[15936.38s - 15939.50s] including how violations of basic human rights
[15939.54s - 15942.34s] breed generational hatred.
[15942.34s - 15945.38s] This I think is an important lesson to understand.
[15945.38s - 15948.14s] The consequences of our moral failings
[15948.14s - 15951.38s] can reverberate through decades, even centuries.
[15951.38s - 15954.38s] And that is perhaps one of the values of studying history.
[15954.38s - 15956.98s] It is laden with atrocities,
[15956.98s - 15960.62s] but it also contains people who, while flawed,
[15960.62s - 15962.98s] dare to rise in some way
[15962.98s - 15965.58s] above the moral decrepitude of the day
[15965.58s - 15966.98s] to try to build a foundation
[15966.98s - 15969.46s] of a slightly better future world,
[15970.42s - 15973.74s] and to build a better future for all of us.
[15973.74s - 15975.62s] As the MLK Jr. put it,
[15975.62s - 15978.98s] the arc of moral universe is long,
[15978.98s - 15981.06s] but it bends towards justice.
[15982.34s - 15985.10s] And now please allow me to say a few words
[15985.10s - 15987.66s] about Gaza, Israel, and Palestine.
[15988.54s - 15991.22s] I'm not sure I'm eloquent enough
[15991.22s - 15995.10s] or know quite the right words to express what I'm feeling,
[15995.10s - 15995.94s] but let me try.
[15996.26s - 15998.42s] I think that the Israeli government
[15998.42s - 16000.58s] is directly responsible for it.
[16001.66s - 16004.18s] And to the degree the US government
[16004.18s - 16006.86s] is assisting the Israeli government in this,
[16006.86s - 16008.82s] which I believe it currently is,
[16008.82s - 16010.74s] it needs to stop immediately.
[16011.74s - 16013.26s] For me as an American,
[16013.26s - 16016.10s] it makes me sick to know that my government
[16016.10s - 16019.18s] has any role in this atrocity.
[16020.46s - 16021.66s] This needs to stop.
[16021.66s - 16025.58s] Yes, there's geopolitical and military complexity,
[16025.58s - 16028.26s] nuance, and historical context
[16028.26s - 16031.10s] that I'm told by some so-called experts
[16031.10s - 16032.50s] that one must understand.
[16033.38s - 16036.18s] And perhaps they are smarter than me.
[16036.18s - 16037.90s] But like mentioned before,
[16037.90s - 16040.46s] unlike the moral complexity of deep history
[16040.46s - 16042.26s] that I've often spoken about,
[16042.26s - 16046.02s] from the Roman Empire to the Atlantic slave trade,
[16046.02s - 16048.94s] this is the 21st century.
[16048.94s - 16052.26s] This is the 21st century.
[16052.26s - 16053.82s] This is today.
[16053.82s - 16055.78s] In this, the 21st century,
[16055.78s - 16058.58s] I see things quite simply and clearly.
[16059.50s - 16062.58s] To me, the death of a child is a tragedy.
[16063.70s - 16066.38s] It doesn't matter what their skin color is,
[16066.38s - 16068.10s] what their religion is,
[16068.10s - 16070.66s] or what plot of land they call home.
[16071.90s - 16074.46s] In my view, they are all equal.
[16075.62s - 16078.26s] And the death of each child is a tragedy.
[16079.74s - 16084.38s] Hamas did a definitively evil act on October 7th,
[16084.38s - 16087.74s] brutally murdering over 1,000 civilians.
[16087.74s - 16092.38s] But now, the acts of war conducted by the Israeli government
[16092.38s - 16096.42s] have led to the death of over 60,000 people in Gaza,
[16096.42s - 16099.54s] likely over 80,000 people,
[16099.54s - 16102.66s] of which at least 17,000 are children.
[16104.02s - 16105.30s] 17,000.
[16107.10s - 16108.82s] I'm not smart enough to know
[16109.66s - 16113.30s] the path to peace and flourishing
[16113.30s - 16115.66s] of all the peoples in the region.
[16115.66s - 16119.18s] But I do know that what has been happening in Gaza
[16119.18s - 16120.62s] cannot be the way.
[16122.06s - 16127.06s] Suffering at this kind of scale breeds generational hate
[16127.46s - 16131.54s] that leads to more evil in the world, not less,
[16131.54s - 16134.86s] to more destruction, to more suffering.
[16136.30s - 16137.46s] This has to stop.
[16138.82s - 16141.38s] Two years ago, I spoke with many Palestinians
[16141.38s - 16144.70s] in the West Bank, on camera and off.
[16144.70s - 16145.98s] There's a video of it up
[16145.98s - 16148.86s] if you want to hear their voices for yourselves.
[16149.90s - 16152.66s] It was a deeply moving experience for me,
[16152.66s - 16153.98s] and I'm grateful for it.
[16154.82s - 16156.34s] In the future, I hope to find a way
[16156.34s - 16157.90s] to talk to people in Gaza.
[16159.02s - 16161.02s] I still think it's valuable to talk to leaders,
[16161.02s - 16165.62s] historians, soldiers, activists, from all perspectives.
[16165.62s - 16167.94s] But the most powerful and moving conversations
[16167.94s - 16170.22s] for me on mic and off
[16170.22s - 16172.30s] have always been with everyday people.
[16173.22s - 16175.54s] This always felt like where the truth is,
[16175.54s - 16180.54s] the deeper truth of life, of pain, fear, of hope.
[16182.62s - 16184.86s] And I still have hope.
[16184.86s - 16187.86s] I believe we humans are good at the core,
[16187.86s - 16189.90s] and I know we'll find our way.
[16190.90s - 16192.42s] Thank you for listening.
[16192.42s - 16193.26s] I love you all.
[16197.94s - 16198.78s] Thank you.
